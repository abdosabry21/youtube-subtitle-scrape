78
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,380

00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,160

00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,360
gifts

00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,400
um and especially to the people that

92
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,139
have been there for me for a long time

93
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,580
and have been there with me from the

94
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,320
jump so this person I'm getting a gift

95
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,000
for has been basically a part of my

96
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,039
journey has helped kind of support me

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,360
through the highs and the lows over yeah

98
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,740
ever since I basically started my

99
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,680
business so as a little token of

100
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,919
appreciation I'm buying them a car thank

101
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,919
you

102
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,740
that's what you Dubai first bro yeah

103
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,940
that's for sure all right see I'm

104
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,759
looking to spend around a million

105
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,740
Dirhams that's like 270 000 so right now

106
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,919
the options are Porsche 911 Turbo S

107
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:29,000
Bentley Continental GT G63 but honestly

108
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:32,280
there is common as a taxi here

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,400
or a Ferrari Roma

110
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,740
911 Turbo S is the best car out of those

111
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,020
but it's a driver's car and driving into

112
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,600
like getting from place to place and

113
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,919
driving to enjoy yourself and in Dubai

114
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,960
you're basically just stuck on a highway

115
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,880
most of the time obviously the Roma is

116
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,880
also a driver's that Porsche is nice

117
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,860
obviously the Roma is also a driver's

118
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,139
car but at least you're in a driver's

119
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,419
car that you have that thrill of being

120
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,860
in a Ferrari whereas yeah I don't know I

121
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,300
just I don't know I just think on the

122
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,160
highways in Dubai you're just not going

123
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,780
to get that same thing in a Porsche so

124
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,100
uh which one which one because I have

125
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,020

126
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,520

but at the end of the day it is her

136
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,720
decision

137
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,280

156
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,660
like I got a cup of this [ __ ] two times

157
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,279
so big news I bought a Supercar now this

158
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,839
Supercar actually isn't for me it's a

159
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:37,080
present it's a gift there are quite a

160
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,120
few people from back in 2016 2017 sort

161
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,800
of early stages of my career that were

162
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,240
really there for me when I was just

163
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,979
starting out and throughout the years

164
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,140
I've done various different things to

165
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,000
show my appreciation help them in any

166
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,800
way that I can most of it is very

167
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,720
private I don't really tell anyone or

168
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,680
talk about anything but Alex said that

169
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,240
you know what maybe it'd be

170
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,279
inspirational for you to get to a point

171
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,899
where not only can you buy a Supercar

172
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,000
for yourself more importantly you can

173
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:01,620
buy a Supercar for your loved ones and

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,660
the people who are really theirs through

175
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,580
thick and thin so after I show you the

176
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,560
car I think I will explain why I ended

177
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:11,640
up picking this specific car as the gift

178
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:18,120
so I ended up buying a Ferrari all right

179
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:20,519
I bought a brand new 2023 Ferrari Roma

180
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,440
uh I guess this is the first thing to

181
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,839
mention is that you can quite easily fit

182
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,160
like a weekend bag even two weekend bags

183
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,380
in the trunk of this so it's actually

184
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,839
quite a practical car to have day in day

185
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,240
out oh man it's so hot like this is

186
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,160
genuinely a very good day-to-day car

187
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,380
which you genuinely can't say about a

188
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,000
lot of Ferraris except for their new SUV

189
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,740
except I think they call it fuv the

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,600
Paris anyway I got the car in red and

191
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,880
then just got wrapped with Sam black I

192
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,220
think listen it's a understated Ferrari

193
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,480
and it's just one of the few practical

194
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,040
Ferraris that you can have as I said

195
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,420
you've seen the boot space the fact that

196
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,279
you even get that boot space in a car

197
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,620
like this is very impressive it's a V8

198
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,600
as well as a eight-speed gearbox it does

199
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,860
Drive beautifully I will say is that in

200
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,480
Dubai you don't really get a chance to

201
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,580
get a feel for this car this car is

202
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,620
actually going to be sent off next May

203
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,080
for the mod ball rally and this car will

204
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,300
be touring Europe and I feel for a rally

205
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:13,040
in Europe this will be an amazing car to

206
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,040
drive apart from that let's hop inside

207
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,820
all right so one thing you'll notice

208
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,459
about this car is the interior in my

209
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,260
opinion is beautiful I love this split

210
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,519
cabin design in terms of being on the

211
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,019
passenger side I don't know what this

212
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,220
display is called so it's cool if your

213
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,839
passenger here you can check the

214
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,700
performance of the car the Rev count

215
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,160
what gear you're in stuff like that you

216
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,200
can change the song settings etc etc I

217
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,640
know some people hate this interior some

218
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,740
people love it couple things I don't

219
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,779
like about this infotainment is very

220
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,760
clunky but then again it's also Ferrari

221
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:43,260
so like what do you expect I will show

222
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,700
them something cool if you're going

223
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,620
somewhere you can either have it the

224
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,019
fastest way the shortest way in terms of

225
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,700
distance or it can show you the most fun

226
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:52,260
way one day I was driving this car and I

227
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,760
set it to the most fun route and in

228
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,320
Dubai was no fun at all so I feel like

229
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,600
this works if you're in the countryside

230
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,760
in England if you're in Italy if you're

231
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,500
most places in the world but in Dubai as

232
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,940
I said fun route it's really not too

233
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,620
many of those so best thing to do is

234
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,240
just put it at the fastest route so

235
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,980
another interesting thing if you push

236
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,300
from Auto let's say you go to manual and

237
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,040
you want to use the paddle shifters it

238
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,660
does this little sort of like see this

239
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,779
red light up thing I thought that was

240
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,779
cool

241
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,200
now when you're inside the car it

242
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,579
doesn't sound that great obviously bear

243
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,579
in mind we're not driving at the moment

244
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,980
one thing I really don't like about this

245
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,480
car is the engine stop start it's like

246
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,640
this little touch pad which for me

247
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,019
personally I just think is um

248
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,700
I would prefer something a little bit

249
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,740
more tactile but speaking about tactile

250
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,899
to go from different modes so you've got

251
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,399
wet Comfort sport I don't know what

252
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,899
technical term is for this but it's got

253
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,339
this sort of metallic switch it is

254
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,720
similar to a lot of other Ferraris but

255
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,339
as I said it's just very satisfying

256
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,620
where I am there's a lot of speed bumps

257
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,779
and at the moment I'm specking my 812

258
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,040
GTS with that car for example you would

259
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,480
have to be very careful over the speed

260
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,500
bumps you'd have to put in Comfort mode

261
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,360
and then you have to raise the

262
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,980
suspension whereas this can comfort you

263
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,779
pretty much good then you got sport mode

264
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,399
and then you got race mode when you put

265
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:04,560
on race mode the back end is very

266
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,540
unpredictable so especially here in

267
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,760
Dubai Comfort or sport you're pretty

268
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:22,789
much good

269
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:22,789
[Music]

270
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,260
all right

271
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,300
the reason I got this car at first I was

272
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,060
looking at a wagon now wagons in Dubai

273
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,800
around a million derms like 270 thousand

274
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:38,820
dollars putting a brand new from

275
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,500
Mercedes is 1.06 so almost a 300 000 or

276
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,360
a car I've had people tell me because I

277
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,220
was mentioning the Range Rover SV price

278
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,899
the Phantom price stuff like that and

279
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,940
people are like no that car isn't that

280
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,339
much guys all you need to do is look up

281
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,959
the price in Dubai in Dubai have no cars

282
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,639
are substantially more expensive but

283
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:55,139
when I buy in London for example it is

284
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,139
substantially cheaper than buying here

285
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:59,700
now Aromas are around 1.1 1.2 million

286
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,620
depends on the spec that you get so

287
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,899
that's a 300 000 car so yeah we

288
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,339
basically whittled it down euruses hate

289
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:07,139
irises so that was out of the question

290
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:08,579
wagons they're just kind of a little too

291
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:09,600
common so I thought you know what let's

292
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,220
just get something a little bit more

293
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,019
special so that basically whittled it

294
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,180
down between the 911 Turbo S the

295
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:17,820
Continental GT and the Roma I feel like

296
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,200
the 911 Turbo S and the Roma kind of

297
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,000
fall into the same category of a

298
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,060
driver's car so then when looking at the

299
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,860
911 Turbo S and the Ferrari Roma they're

300
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,480
both still everyday cars but they've got

301
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,920
power to them and I'd say they're driver

302
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,019
cars they're not going to give you the

303
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,180
luxuries that a Continental GT will give

304
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:35,579
you the 911 Turbo S is around a million

305
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,959
Dirhams so maybe thirty thousand forty

306
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:38,220
thousand dollars cheaper than this car

307
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,779
but if you're spending that much money

308
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,339
and you're not really getting the best

309
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:43,079
out of the car in terms of Driving

310
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:44,820
Experience and what would you rather sit

311
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:46,920
in a Ferrari or a Porsche I mean it's

312
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,260
there's no question about it so for that

313
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,399
reason the 911 Turbo S then was out of

314
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,680
the equation and it was basically

315
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,779
between the Continental GT which as I

316
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,160
said I think that car has slept on I

317
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,019
personally love Bentley's I understand

318
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,139
they don't have that exciting factor

319
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:02,519
that a Ferrari does that a that a

320
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,899
Porsche does but I just think they're

321
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,180
great cars so yeah basically then we

322
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:08,160
whittled it down to a Continental GT in

323
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,959
a Ferrari Roma and long story short

324
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,399
ended up deciding on a Ferrari because

325
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,019
listen at the end of the day a Ferrari

326
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,700
is a Ferrari and I think when you get

327
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,440
gifted a Ferrari that's a special

328
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,180
feeling I think that was basically the

329
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,040
thought process when it came down to

330
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,060
deciding which car to buy it's funny to

331
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,800
see the comments as well whenever

332
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,839
anyone's like oh you know it's so weird

333
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,820
to see email driving I love driving I

334
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,860
just don't like driving in Dubai is

335
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,779
genuinely a very unpleasant experience

336
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,760
but for example in Cape Town I drive all

337
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,260
the time Europe I drive all the time so

338
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,700
yeah it's just always funny to see the

339
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,079
comments like oh it's so weird seeing

340
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,579
you man drive I think listen of course

341
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:40,320
you know when you're you have a dream

342
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,579
you have a vision to have a super car to

343
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,320
have a sports car whatever it may be

344
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:45,180
it's always like this dream of driving

345
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,399
this super aggressive powerful car I

346
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,260
think if you work hard if you dedicate

347
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,480
if you think in terms of years even

348
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,620
decades and not months you will get this

349
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,060
and I'm gonna be very honest with you

350
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,620
for a lot of you depends on what city

351
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,699
you live once you get this you'll

352
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,139
realize it's not what it's made out to

353
00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:00,560
be listen of course it's fun to do this

354
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,560
sometimes

355
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,040
yeah sure it's fun to floor it every

356
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,360
once in a while but if you live in

357
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,740
London if you live in New York if you

358
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,000
live in Dubai you know what I mean if

359
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,279
you live in Paris you don't get to do

360
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,199
this often you don't get to just put it

361
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,880
down and send it

362
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,260
so for all of you I know that you will

363
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,880
get something like this in your life I

364
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,320
know you'll accomplish this I always

365
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,579
like to give people the warning that

366
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,959
most of the things they want in life

367
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,339
once they get there they'll realize that

368
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,360
maybe it's not what it's made out this

369
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,459
evening and in certain cities

370
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,380
unfortunately it's uh something that can

371
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:30,360
cause you a lot of headache I mean

372
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,339
imagine having this car in London for

373
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,139
example even just parking like at least

374
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,000
Dubai you got valet and stuff like that

375
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,279
but even just parking is a headache so

376
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,139
go out there work hard forget the

377
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,579
concept of time and one day I know

378
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,980
you'll be able to buy this for yourself

379
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:46,019
and hopefully maybe you'll even be able

380
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,579
to buy this for your loved ones and

381
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,660
share all of the success and all the

382
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:51,260
blessings that you've been able to bring

383
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,260
into your life
