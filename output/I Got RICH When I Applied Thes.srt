19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,120

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,559
to in life now the first secret

22
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,660
millionaire trait and I have seen this

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,000
with every single millionaire that I

24
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,100
have ever met including myself and by

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,260
the way this is even more especially

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,660
true with a billionaire friends that I

27
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,700
have they possess this trait even more

28
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,040
and that is they think that they're

29
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,360
special and in fact to an extent they

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,920
even think that they're better than

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,479
other people now I know a lot of you

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,979
guys may take this the wrong way and you

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,780
may think oh that's terrible to think

34
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,880
that you know you're better than other

35
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,979
people now bear in mind you're not

36
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,840
disrespectful towards other people but

37
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,400
in certain domains you're better than

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,140
other people you think Michael Jordan

39
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,180
doesn't look at everyone around him and

40
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,500
goes yeah I'm better than you guys do

41
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,820
you think that industry leaders and

42
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,619
shakers don't look at themselves and go

43
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,960
yeah you know I've got something special

44
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,640
to me now when it gets dangerous and I'm

45
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,020
sure we all know these people are the

46
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,000
ones that think that they are special

47
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,380
but they won't put in the work the

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,240
reason you can think you are better than

49
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,360
other people is because you have simply

50
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,640
put in more hours more time and more

51
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,560
work so listen you should absolutely

52
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,420
believe you are special you should

53
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,799
absolutely believe that almost to an

54
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,680
extent you're better than most other

55
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,960
people who are so brain dead so asleep

56
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,939
are so scared to run towards the things

57
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,159
they want in life so there is apps

58
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,619
nothing wrong with having these feelings

59
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,659
as long as you back it up because if you

60
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,880
don't back it up then it is simply

61
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,979
delusional and I will be honest with you

62
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,540
there are lots of people as I said I'm

63
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,099
sure you know lots of people that are

64
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,599
extremely delusional they're like I'm

65
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,819
gonna be a billionaire

66
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,800
cool do you have a plan do you have any

67
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,780
sort of road map in fact let's put that

68
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,340
to the side have you even made ten

69
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,480
thousand dollars in your life have you

70
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,980
made a hundred thousand dollars in your

71
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,959
life so let's not talk about billionaire

72
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,940
status yet so as I said you never ever

73
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,560
want to be delusional in life we should

74
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,080
always have that feeling of being

75
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,220
special of being meant for more in life

76
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,319
you know I can tell you for a fact

77
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,780
growing up from the age of even six or

78
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,940
seven I just had that feeling that I was

79
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,560
destined for more that something great

80
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,000
was gonna come out of my life and that

81
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,459
was even from a young age and I remember

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,440
even you know in school at the age of 13

83
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,239
or 14 years old feeling a sense of like

84
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,920
yeah I was better than my peers even

85
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,900
though at that time I hate to use the

86
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,420
word bullying but I was being picked on

87
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,580
heavily I was a complete Outcast to

88
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,920
complete Outsider within the realm of

89
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,900
school I failed in every single Arena

90
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,580
you could think of and yet I still had

91
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,379
that feeling of like no no I'm working

92
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,760
towards something bigger I was trying

93
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,739
little side hustles and little

94
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,319
businesses and this and that so in life

95
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,459
humility is extremely important and you

96
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,540
should be able to assess your life

97
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,400
situation and look at your life

98
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,080
situation and not be like as I said

99
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,640
these idiots that are like oh I'm gonna

100
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,900
be a billionaire and they just sit on

101
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,239
their ass all day and don't do anything

102
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,220
about it you should feel special and

103
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,680
then you should put in a special amount

104
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,540
of work a special amount of dedication

105
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,060
to prove it to the world and that's

106
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,040
exactly what I did now the next secret

107
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,680
millionaire trait that you need to

108
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,739
possess is you need to develop a high

109
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,319
stress tolerance I tell people Time and

110
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,879
Time and Time Again they're more than

111
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,319
likely most people think they want my

112
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,959
life but they don't really want my life

113
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,700
because listen it's not easy to have 150

114
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,620
employees between multiple various

115
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,299
companies managing that with complex

116
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,340
different corporate structures and

117
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,440
trusts around the world and Investments

118
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,480
and Family Planning and taking care of

119
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,879
my mom and my friends and my loved ones

120
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,980
imagine that with all the social media

121
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,480
online bs and all the stuff that comes

122
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,040
with it but I've told people the reason

123
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,500
that I can deal with it is because I

124
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,480
have an extremely high stress tolerance

125
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,580
so I need you to understand don't

126
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,500
believe all of the self-help BS that

127
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,180
it's just going to be all roses and

128
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,100
fairy tales and if you feel stressed

129
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,479
today take a break you know give

130
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,759
yourself a break you deserve a break

131
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:25,919
you've done no work and you faced your

132
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,600
first challenge your first obstacle but

133
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,580
you know focus on your mental health

134
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,699
just you know don't push yourself too

135
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,320
much it's absolutely ridiculous the

136
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,120
world we live in as I said I like to

137
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,080
talk very transparently and openly to

138
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,820
people

139
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,639
it will be stressful

140
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,740
it will be painful you will suffer from

141
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,540
mental health issues and that comes with

142
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,580
a territory in the same way you cannot

143
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,800
expect to be a world-class bodybuilder

144
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,960
or be a bodybuilder that steps on stage

145
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,940
and you say I want to be a bodybuilder

146
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,919
and I want to step on stage but when I

147
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,900
go to the gym it can't hurt the second

148
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,060
that it hurts I'm gonna take a break

149
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,560
because I gotta focus on myself and like

150
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,240
you know I don't want to push myself too

151
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,040
much and it's all about like taking care

152
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,139
of yourself you know if you want to have

153
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,220
that mentality that is totally fine you

154
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,900
will never get to where you want to get

155
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,759
to in life and by the way there's

156
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,919
genuinely and I know I'm I talk very

157
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,540
intense sometimes there's genuinely

158
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,479
nothing wrong with that I think if you

159
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,520
want to be some billionaire CEO or you

160
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,580
just want to make 30 40 Grand a month

161
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,380
have some sort of online side hustle and

162
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,300
surf all day whatever you want to do

163
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,120
that is totally cool as long as it is a

164
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,340
hundred percent congruent and honest to

165
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,199
your Life Path and it's something that

166
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,780
you choose I've told people many times

167
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,340
when they ask me I go listen I am built

168
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,740
for this life because I have an insane

169
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,060
stress tolerance but my life is not the

170
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,259
same life that other people should live

171
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,400
but the reason you clicked on this video

172
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,320
is because you want to learn how to

173
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,479
become a millionaire and as I said if

174
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,400
you want to get to that position you

175
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,259
need to increase your ability to handle

176
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,699
stress now bear in mind one thing I will

177
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,380
say it's not something that needs to

178
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,600
happen overnight it's something that

179
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,900
progresses I can handle a certain level

180
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,080
of stress in 2023 that I simply couldn't

181
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,820
handle in 2018 or 2019 in fact some of

182
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,259
my biggest businesses with the most

183
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,000
amount of employees the reason that I

184
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,220
didn't pursue or start those businesses

185
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,440
or move forward with those businesses in

186
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,240
2018 or 2019 even though I was given the

187
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,979
opportunity to people wanted to start

188
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,259
the businesses with me give me Equity

189
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:21,720
blah blah all this is because I simply

190
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:23,940
knew that back then I did not have the

191
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,800
stress tolerance to be able to deal with

192
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,660
it so it's not an overnight thing it's

193
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,340
something that you build over time but

194
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,340
as I said don't come to the first

195
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,900
roadblock and think oh it's tough It's

196
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,100
not meant to be tough this is It's you

197
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,419
know it's all meant to be roses and

198
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,340
fairy tales I'm just trying to give you

199
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:40,979
very clear expectations I think when

200
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,199
someone can talk to you very openly and

201
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:45,419
honestly and say then listen it's not

202
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,860
all perfect I feel like at least you're

203
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,479
a little bit more prepared to go into

204
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,740
war so definitely I can say this about

205
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,180
myself and definitely I can say this

206
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,880
about some of the most successful people

207
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,919
I know in any realm in life by the way

208
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,780
any realm whether that's Sports whether

209
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,759
that's business whether that's even a

210
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,680
high income career working for a very

211
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,440
lucrative company you need to be able to

212
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,660
handle a high level of stress and

213
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,160
embrace it the third trait to become a

214
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,919
millionaire that simply isn't talked

215
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,600
about enough is your charisma and your

216
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,800
ability to persuade now of course

217
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,080
everyone knows this you know everyone

218
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,660
knows it but people don't Place enough

219
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,400
emphasis on it you need to learn how to

220
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,020
have Charisma and this is something that

221
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,460
you can train by the way bear in mind

222
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,560
most people don't assume this about me

223
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:28,020
I'm actually naturally an introvert I

224
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,460
like to be alone I like to chill but if

225
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,500
there's a time and a place where I need

226
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,840
to be I am extremely charismatic because

227
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,639
I understand that people like to listen

228
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,500
to people who carry themselves in a

229
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,060
survey who have a certain Aura and as I

230
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,000
said that doesn't mean talking the most

231
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,560
it just means learning Charisma and you

232
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,539
need to understand that if you don't

233
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,360
learn Charisma if you don't learn

234
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:50,580
persuasion you will be underpaid and

235
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,259
you'll be under booked so listen whether

236
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,300
you're trying to land a high income

237
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,360
career whether you're trying to sign

238
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,639
clients and get business and sign deals

239
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,380
as a business owner or you're trying to

240
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,940
be charismatic in order to inspire

241
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,759
people to work for you at your company

242
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,380
you need to learn this trait so real

243
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,020
quick guys before we get into the fourth

244
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,940

249
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,940
place for me to do it and my personal

250
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,680
Instagram is just a joke to me it's just

251
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,539
where I post some photo dumps from

252
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,160

00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:28,139

happen I try my best anyways moving on

268
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:57,240
to the fourth trait you want to focus on

269
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,860
Mastery not passion and it's another big

270
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,300
thing I've been telling people for years

271
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,680
you know it's funny I've started to look

272
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,899
at the self-help industry and realize

273
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,180
just how much bad it's doing for the

274
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,640
world like just how astray it's leading

275
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,019
people trying to tell people hey focus

276
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,980
on your passion let me tell you

277
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,959
something what you're passionate about

278
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,160
today you won't be passionate about in a

279
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,200
month and sometimes your biggest

280
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,820
passions in life when money is involved

281
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,500
in it it doesn't stay a passion anymore

282
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,519
so what you're passionate about today is

283
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,560
not what you're going to be passionate

284
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,019
about in 30 years but what you commit to

285
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,040
today you will still be a master at in

286
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,779
30 years and let me tell you something

287
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,940
when you are very good at something and

288
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:31,920
you know that you always enjoy it you

289
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,080
may not be over the moon passionate

290
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,060
elated about it all the time but you

291
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,620
always enjoy it and respect it and you

292
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,360
also want to continue doing it because

293
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,399
you understand how much blood Blood

294
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,200
Sweat and Tears went into it so in life

295
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,820
don't focus on your passions find

296
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,500
something you're interested in dedicate

297
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,540
yourself to it focus on being a master

298
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,160
at it now once you're a master at it or

299
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,380
once you're very good at it then you can

300
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,820
add some other skills on top of it and

301
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,980
that's really where you sort of Stack

302
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,480
your abilities and stack the portfolio

303
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,640
of things that you're very good at but

304
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,680
the main thing is just please stop it

305
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,300
with a passion the things that

306
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,459
you are passionate about should be your

307
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,260
hobbies that's your down time that's

308
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:09,000
your off time because those things can

309
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,160
always change but when it comes to your

310
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,019
work when it comes to your career focus

311
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,880
on something where you hate it for a

312
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,620
long time but it doesn't matter you stay

313
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,060
dedicated to it this is where I have so

314
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,920
much respect for the Japanese culture

315
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,779
because I see it time and time again in

316
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,700
Japan teenagers will come on as

317
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,560
apprentices and learn how to make knives

318
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,940
and they will do that for the next 60

319
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,080
years of their life and I can tell you

320
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,000
for a large portion of it they probably

321
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,740
hate it or they find it boring but it

322
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,899
doesn't matter they find something and

323
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,700
they stick to it they have honor for the

324
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,320
craft and I think that's that's really

325
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,360
what it's missing in a modern society is

326
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,540
everything just needs to feel good it

327
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,420
and feel positive no focus on Mastery

328
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,940
not passion the next secret millionaire

329
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,860
trait is you need to have an ego now

330
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,360
everyone says oh ego is bad this and

331
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,740
that and let me tell you something I've

332
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,720
said it for years I've said it time and

333
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,640
time again you need to have some sort of

334
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,079
faith I don't care what religion you

335
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,120
prescribe to I don't care what you

336
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,920
believe in unless it's atheist that's

337
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,120
just the one thing I have never gotten

338
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,620
behind and I don't think I could ever

339
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,060
get behind but pretty much everything

340
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,740
else as long as you know that there is

341
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,839
something bigger than yourself and that

342
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,459
humbles you and you let life humble you

343
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,260
and you put yourself through difficult

344
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:15,240
situations where life continuously

345
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,800
humbles you then your ego will stay in

346
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,079
check but that doesn't mean don't have

347
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,519
an ego at all ego is what pushes people

348
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,200
to Excellence I can tell you something

349
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,120
right now at my company is the reason

350
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,940
that I demand Excellence from my team

351
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,519
and me is partly ego I love the fact

352
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,500
that I know my team is the sharpest in

353
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,180
an industry I love the fact that when we

354
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,920
roll out a new feature on my software

355
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,300
company I'm like those guys didn't do it

356
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,100
or you know what those guys have been

357
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,480
around for six years and we came in in

358
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,339
the last two years and complete glue

359
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,200
them out the water and listen that comes

360
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,880
from ego think about the best people in

361
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,260
any Industries in the world they always

362
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,820
tell themselves hey whatever you can do

363
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,140
I can do better and that's not a bad

364
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,480
thing at all as long as they still

365
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,220
submit to higher power a religion a

366
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,920
belief whatever it is as long as they do

367
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,320
some sort of prayer meditation even just

368
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,880
gratitude journaling just something to

369
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,500
Humble themselves and as long as they

370
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,660
put themselves through very difficult

371
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,920
life situations that as I said will

372
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,540
humble them we'll put them in their

373
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,240
place I get humbled all the time yeah

374
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,440
sure I accomplished a fair amount at my

375
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,519
age and I understand a lot of people

376
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,260
look up to me but that's why I always

377
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,240
put myself in very difficult situations

378
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,920
where I know life is gonna humble me and

379
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,480
I'm gonna be put in my place as it

380
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,399
should be so as long as you do that

381
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,040
don't listen to this whole self-help

382
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,380
world have an ego it's a good thing the

383
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,700
sixth secret millionaire trait is that

384
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,560
they're always thinking what could go

385
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,820
wrong and once again as I said it's very

386
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,079
different to the whole self-help world

387
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,000
because they're always thinking positive

388
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,980
affirmation blah blah this that no no

389
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,779
one of the biggest reasons that I got to

390
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,700
where I am in life is because I do a lot

391
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:40,440
of visualization before bed but what

392
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,600
I've been visualize you know for example

393
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,940
growing up I never visualized buying a

394
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,800
Ferrari or Rolls-Royce or buying my mom

395
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,240
a four million dollar house in cash I

396
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,040
never visualized those things because I

397
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,420
knew that if I do the right actions

398
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,620
those things are going to come and those

399
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,839
things have come I've done all those

400
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,839
things instead I visualize the actions

401
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,940
but I focused on it being difficult what

402
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,500
I would do when things got difficult and

403
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,000
me getting past that so I'll give you an

404
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,500
example let's say you really struggle to

405
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,360
wake up in the morning you visualize

406
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,040
getting up when the alarm goes off in

407
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,320
the morning but it's difficult it's not

408
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,880
easy you prepare yourself for it to be

409
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,800
difficult you prepare yourself to wake

410
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,720
up and just be like wanting to hit the

411
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,820
snooze button and you have every reason

412
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,440
not to get out of bed and you fight with

413
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,880
your demons and you still get out of bed

414
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,620
you know why because when you wake up in

415
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,180
the morning you only have one chance per

416
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,440
day and you might fail so you're gonna

417
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,000
have to wait until the next day to do it

418
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,860
but in your mind which by the way can't

419
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,540
concede between reality and Imagination

420
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,000
that's why visualization especially

421
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,920
before bed is such a powerful tool in

422
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,480
your mind you can practice waking up 15

423
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,560
times in your imagination before you

424
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,540
wake up the next morning and you can

425
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,800
imagine it being difficult and you

426
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,260
trying to convince yourself to stay in

427
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,300
bed but still getting past it so that

428
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,220
for example is an exercise in always

429
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,260
thinking what could go wrong so that way

430
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,000
you can prepare for things so even to

431
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,040
this day I'm always thinking what could

432
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,079
go wrong I'm always looking at all of my

433
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,279
businesses or my structures or this that

434
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,839
and I'm always saying what could go

435
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,279
wrong I'm thinking hey maybe if this

436
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,899
partner in this business tries to

437
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,519
me over you know what do I do in that

438
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:04,260
situation and it's not negative thinking

439
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,180
it's just preparation it's always

440
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,220
preparing yourself and this is something

441
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,959
that so few people out there talk about

442
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,459
but I can tell you honest you want to

443
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,839
get into the big leagues these people

444
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:14,579
and I can definitely tell you that I do

445
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,200
it we're always thinking what could go

446
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:18,120
wrong we're always thinking seven steps

447
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,920
ahead and you know what in an ideal

448
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,899
world nothing goes wrong and that's

449
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,820
great but at least you've planned these

450
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,139
things too and not only that it gets

451
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,300
your mind thinking it gets your mind

452
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:29,399
thinking in a different perspective and

453
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,740
it forces you to become a problem solver

454
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,720
so if you want to become a millionaire

455
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,700
you always need to think what could go

456
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,459
wrong and start formulating solutions

457
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:41,760
for problems that may not even arise yet

458
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:43,860
the last secret millionaire trade is

459
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,779
that they understand achieving success

460
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:49,139
is relatively easy

461
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:50,639
staying there and continuing success is

462
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,260
extremely hard and as I said looking

463
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,699
around I always see people go oh I'm

464
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,620
gonna become successful blah blah this

465
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:57,420
app for me because I've been documenting

466
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,399
every step of the journey since I was 15

467
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,139
years old on YouTube I started my first

468
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,820
business when I was 14 but because I've

469
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,800
documented every step of the journey and

470
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,480
I've kind of outlined exactly what I was

471
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,860
going to do before I did it I guess it's

472
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,660
easy enough for me to say but I

473
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,459
genuinely believe if you stick to

474
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,260
something long enough you will become

475
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:15,660
successful so for me that was never

476
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,760
really what I focused on instead what I

477
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,160
focus on my mind was really consumed by

478
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,420
was how do we stay there because as I

479
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,500
said if you manage to make a million

480
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,959
dollars I mean that's cool

481
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,120
congratulations but I mean it's really

482
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,220
not that special if you manage to do it

483
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,380
over and over and over and have

484
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,300
continued success in an industry or

485
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,579
maybe pivot to another industry and

486
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,380
flourish in that industry that is really

487
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,699
what the Legends are made of so don't

488
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,500
think that oh I'm gonna build up my

489
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:42,300
business or build up my career and make

490
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,500
a lot of money and then that's it I

491
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,120
can't tell you how many people I've seen

492
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,560
get to that position and then they kick

493
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,120
up their feet they get comfortable and

494
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,620
by the way I know video I've talked

495
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,820
about hey it's good to have an ego and

496
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,320
you need to think that you're special in

497
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,139
the sense those things aren't bad things

498
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,820
let me tell you what's truly egotistical

499
00:15:55,139 --> 00:16:00,060
getting to a position in life and

500
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:02,160
thinking that okay I'm good now that is

501
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,420
truly egotistical you need to understand

502
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,519
that once you get to where you want to

503
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,500
get to in life you've just started now

504
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,180
you got to stay there and that is the

505
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,680
real difficulty so ladies and gentlemen

506
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,480
I genuinely think you may want to watch

507
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,279
this video again save it to your watch

508
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,720
later and come back to this video in a

509
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,699
month come back to in six months come

510
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,500
back to in a year because probably the

511
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:22,320
more successful you get you'll start to

512
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,760
realize how true these traits are that I

513
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,440
gave you these seven traits that I just

514
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,360
gave you and you also start to realize

515
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,579
how different it is from all the other

516
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,320
self-help BS that's out there so ladies

517
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:33,839
and gentlemen I hope that was helpful to

518
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,579
you I say all of this genuinely with

519
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,380
love as I said I know I'm very intense

520
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:39,240
sometimes but that's just because

521
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,980
I had to figure out all the on my

522
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,380
own I had no one to teach me this and

523
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:46,259
apart from that as always I'm watching

524
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,860
from afar and I'm genuinely from all my

525
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,860
heart rooted
