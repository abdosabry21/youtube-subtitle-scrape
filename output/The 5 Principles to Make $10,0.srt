11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,160
knows do you know what Socrates

12
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:59,519
Alexander the Great Plato Aristotle

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,359
Leonardo da Vinci and Marcus Aurelius

14
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:03,439
all had in common something beyond their

15
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,400
obvious

16
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,479
geniality well if you're like most

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,479
people you'll probably say something

18
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,280
along the lines of they were all

19
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,920
historical figures who all achieved

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,320
great things which is true or maybe you

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,840
said that they're all long gone which is

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,920
also definitely true but there's

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,200
something else you see although they all

24
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,439
lived hundreds if not even thousands of

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,400
years ago the life of every single one

26
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,600
of these individuals is greatly

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,040
documented in a few ancient writings

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,520
either written by them or their

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,119
followers and in those writings they all

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,399
left behind one of the greatest gifts

31
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,840
that one could fathom during my research

32
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:41,680
as I went through these ancient writings

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,280
trying to figure out the real secret

34
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,479
origins of education and what formula

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,840
they used to create so many Minds back

36
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,560
then I mean Minds that are still

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,399
remembered to this day I stumbled upon

38
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,479
something you see I noticed that every

39
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,640
single one of these men shared five very

40
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:59,360
specific principles that made them the

41
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,799
great figures that they are remembered

42
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,000
as principles that were somewhat common

43
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,439
back then but they were lost somewhere

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,399
along the way and today less than 1% of

45
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,760
the population has them and for a very

46
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,760
specific reason the conditioning Factory

47
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,519
is trying to keep you away from finding

48
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,239
out these because they know that those

49
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:20,519
who possess these five lost traits

50
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,040
they're going to break away from their

51
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,879
social conditioning and stop being a

52
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,080
product of the system and of course they

53
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,440
want to avoid that at all cost but the

54
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,800
truth is buried in these ancient

55
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,400
writings and my goal with this event is

56
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,519
to rescue these five lost long

57
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,120
principles that were once the

58
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,360
foundations of the greatest

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,319
breakthroughs Humanity has ever

60
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,040
experienced and this is what I'm about

61
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:49,319
to give

62
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:51,519
[Music]

63
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,599
you let's go back to the war that was

64
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,599
set in motion by the execution of

65
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,120
Socrates now you may not be aware of

66
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,760
this war but you can see its battles you

67
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,120
actually see them being fought every

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,680
every single day and maybe you even

69
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,959
fight some of these battles yourselves

70
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,519
let me tell you what I'm talking about

71
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,519
I'll give you an example have you

72
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,879
noticed how lately it's kind of becoming

73
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,400
more and more difficult to have a

74
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:14,040
diversity of opinions today if you say

75
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,480
that men and women are different you're

76
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,959
labeled as a sexist or intolerant and if

77
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,840
you say that we should care about

78
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,680
everyone independent of their race that

79
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,480
somehow makes you a racist you see the

80
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,480
fight for diversity somehow led us to

81
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,159
not have diversity of opinions anymore

82
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,200
and the fight for democracy somehow led

83
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,159
us to suppress free speech an open

84
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,080
debate and the fight for inclusion

85
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,519
created this cancel culture where

86
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,200
certain views are just excluded and I'm

87
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:40,360
sure you too have experienced this

88
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,879
yourself almost daily and you to have

89
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,480
probably asked yourself how do we get to

90
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,159
this point well it turns out that they

91
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,760
have been preparing the grounds for this

92
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:51,799
to happen for some decades now but

93
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,040
before I can expand on that you must

94
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,400
first understand this that all of these

95
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,439
battles are a symptom of a much bigger

96
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,000
War that's going on behind the scenes so

97
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:04,760
what is this war on then it's a war on

98
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,760
truth and their goal push civilization

99
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,799
to stage four conditioning where they

100
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,319
completely control what truth is now

101
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,200
what does that even mean war on Truth

102
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,720
controlling the truth what does that

103
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,280
mean in practice well for you to

104
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,560
understand this we first need to go back

105
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,639
in time back to the real origins of

106
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,160
Education not the education we know of

107
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,560
today I'm talking real education the

108
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,840
education that was responsible for

109
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,199
creating the greatest Outsiders that I

110
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,520
mentioned in the beginning of this video

111
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,560
the likes of Socrates Leonardo da Vinci

112
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,430
Alexander the Great and many more this

113
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:42,919
this is the real origin of

114
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:45,320
[Music]

115
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:47,240
Education it all started in ancient

116
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,680
Greece you see in ancient times the

117
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,600
approach to education was very different

118
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,039
from what it is today the Greeks really

119
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,000
cemented their name in history by

120
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,080
providing the foundations for what would

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,199
later be taught in Western universities

122
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,800
throughout an entire Millennium up until

123
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,639
the Rena Rance in the 1300s and it was

124
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,759
all based on one principle the search

125
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,479
for truth they believe that freedom and

126
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,080
Truth were the ultimate outcomes an

127
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,800
individual could seek and pursue and in

128
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,759
order for an individual to pursue such

129
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,440
freedoms they'd have to become critical

130
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,080
thinkers meaning they needed to be

131
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,240
capable of analyzing the world around

132
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,880
them and arriving at a clear

133
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,479
understanding of what the truth really

134
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,800
is and they even had a Latin phrase

135
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:29,280
that's still popular to this day to

136
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,280
describe this search for truth qued East

137
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,400
very

138
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,319
which means what is truth now why is

139
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,039
this so important why was The Pursuit Of

140
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:40,160
Truth such a fundamental concept for the

141
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:43,160
ancient Greeks well think about it right

142
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,560
and wrong good and evil your values your

143
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,160
objectives your culture all of these are

144
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,080
anchored to the understanding you have

145
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,400
about what truth is what you consider to

146
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,240
be right is what another person

147
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,000
considers to be wrong why because your

148
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,919
interpretation of Truth is different and

149
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,560
as a result your conclusions about the

150
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,759
world around you are different as well

151
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,240
well so your beliefs are different and

152
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,840
so are your values which in turn opens

153
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,360
up a series of interesting questions for

154
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,000
example how can you tell who is right

155
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,960
you or the other person who has an

156
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,319
opposing view how can you tell which

157
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,960
truth is the actual truth how can you

158
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,360
know your truth is factual have you ever

159
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,599
thought about why you believe the things

160
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,479
you believe and why you see them as

161
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,639
truth are there logical reasons based on

162
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,520
Cold Heart facts that support your view

163
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:32,000
of what is the truth and those are

164
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,440
questions that you probably rarely ask

165
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,800
yourself and there's a reason why

166
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,400
because this is how you get to the truth

167
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,199
and the ones above you they don't want

168
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,240
you to know about the truth they want

169
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,440
you to be a product of the system

170
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,000
someone who does what they're told and

171
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,160
nothing more and in order for you to do

172
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,960
that you can't find out the real truth

173
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,280
because if you did you wouldn't do what

174
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,199
they tell you you would question them

175
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,120
you wouldn't comply you would follow

176
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,199
different paths so the bottom line is

177
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,360
they don't don't want you to get to the

178
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,520
truth and this is exactly how they keep

179
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,759
you indoctrinated a product of the

180
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,240
system so f for the first time in your

181
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,360
life you truly want to get to the truth

182
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,319
and Peak into what the way to Freedom

183
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,120
not indoctrination actually looks like

184
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,919
then listen closely I'm not going to

185
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,960
give you a peek behind the curtains

186
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,199
instead we'll look to ancient texts

187
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,440
because what I just showed you is the

188
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,240
first of five principles hidden in the

189
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,919
ancient pages that have been written

190
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,479
over decades and centuries ago by the

191
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:34,199
greatest Minds that have stepped into

192
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,080
this world and what I'm about to show

193
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,160
you are the other four principles that

194
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,599
created some of the brightest and most

195
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,280
successful individuals in the history of

196
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:45,639
mankind people who succeeded outside of

197
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,720
the traditional realm or formal path

198
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,560
which they were expected to follow by

199
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,639
the establishment standards and that's

200
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,639
why I call them The Outsiders because

201
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,560
they were able to unwire all the social

202
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,800
conditioning that had been fed by the

203
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,639
conditioning Factory and to succeed

204
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,240
outside of the system they were able to

205
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,960
forge their own path in a world which

206
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,280
did everything to keep them at Bay and

207
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,759
it even cost some of them their life

208
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,039
like Socrates these men were Relentless

209
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,759
in their pursuit of freedom and if you

210
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,639
adopt their principles you can be too

211
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,960
you see by becoming an outsider you are

212
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:23,120
able to unlock something that less than

213
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:26,800
1% of the world's population has today

214
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,599
financial location and time freedom and

215
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,080
once you combine these five forgotten

216
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:34,440
principles you too will be able to

217
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,880
become an outsider so to recap the first

218
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,360
principle of the outsider is you must

219
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,320
establish what truth means for you or in

220
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,399
other words you need to find out what

221
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,240
truth you will Orient Yourself by

222
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,800
because the truth that you choose to

223
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,920
subscribe to will determine your success

224
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,640
listen if you choose to believe that

225
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,000
you're destined for failure if that's

226
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,120
your truth then you will be but the

227
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,320
opposite is true as well that's why it's

228
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,200
so important to establish what truth you

229
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,040
will Orient Yourself by what what truth

230
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,040
actually means for

231
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,920
you now ancient Greece cemented its name

232
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,079
in history not only for being one of the

233
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,240
first civilizations to pursue the idea

234
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:15,640
of truth but because they developed a

235
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,120
method to do so you see getting to the

236
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,800
truth is rarely easy especially because

237
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,279
you know truth can be such a loose

238
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,000
concept I mean after all two people can

239
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:27,200
recount the exact same situation in two

240
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,200
vastly different ways now is one more

241
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,240
true than the other or is either recount

242
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,440
true at all so the first person to truly

243
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,959
develop a method to get to the root of

244
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,279
what truth is was our friend Socrates

245
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:39,680
and the really interesting part of his

246
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,959
character is that he genuinely believed

247
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,120
in his own ignorance and this is exactly

248
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:47,360
how he developed a method to find out

249
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,959
what truth means how he used to

250
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,000
literally walk the street of Athens and

251
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:54,760
engage in conversations with people from

252
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,760
all walks of life I'm talking Craftsmen

253
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:01,600
Artisans vendors poets politicians young

254
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,680
Athen iions and all he'd do was ask them

255
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,480
questions questions about their beliefs

256
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,720
their philosophies and where their

257
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,440
beliefs came from and basically what he

258
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,760
tried to do was to help others recognize

259
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,600
their own ignorance as the first step

260
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,680
towards wisdom you see he believed that

261
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,320
by questioning and examining beliefs

262
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,600
critically one could actually move

263
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,079
closer to the truth he claimed to have

264
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,440
no wisdom of his own and often described

265
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:27,519
his role as that of a midwife helping

266
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,440
others give birth to their own

267
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,760
understanding now as he ate Ed Socrates

268
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,000
method and persistent questioning of

269
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,720
athens's values as well as influential

270
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,040
figures well that made him many enemies

271
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,760
and that series of questioning was what

272
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,240
came to be known as the Socratic method

273
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,320
this method allows you to get to the

274
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,680
real Foundation of your beliefs about a

275
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,839
subject do you want to know what the

276
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,519
method looks like in practice well you

277
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,639
already know it I mean just think back

278
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,079
to the series of questions I asked you a

279
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,279
few minutes ago the ones about the

280
00:10:55,079 --> 00:11:00,680
opposing interpretations of truths that

281
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:03,240
is the Socratic method the exact same

282
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,800
one we used in the mission of episode 1

283
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,880
I've already taught you the Socratic

284
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,760
method in practice without you even

285
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,040
knowing it and let me tell you something

286
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,200
that is probably more than the modern

287
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,279
education system has ever taught you

288
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,279
about how to truly become a critical

289
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,000
thinker asking why you believe something

290
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,839
until you truly get to the root of your

291
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,040
beliefs and the second principle of the

292
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,480
outsider is to evaluate your current

293
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,279
beliefs and figure out where your

294
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,040
limiting beliefs come from remember what

295
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,959
I told you in episode one it does

296
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,079
doesn't matter how hard you work or how

297
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,480
many different new Ventures you try you

298
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:37,240
will keep failing until you unwire the

299
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,839
conditioning that makes you a product of

300
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,839
the system and it's only after you

301
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,639
unwire all of it that you can truly

302
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,200
succeed and this is exactly what we're

303
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,480
getting to here so in order for you to

304
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,800
evaluate your current beliefs and really

305
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,320
understand where they're coming from

306
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,079
just go through the same questioning

307
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,920
process using the Socratic method ask

308
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,480
yourself what are the limiting beliefs

309
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,480
you currently have that are holding you

310
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,360
back maybe you think you can't succeed

311
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,040
outside the the system maybe you think

312
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,920
no one can or perhaps you think you need

313
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,040
some secret knowledge to find this

314
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,920
success now think about it why do you

315
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,639
believe such thing is it because you

316
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,880
deeply researched and reflected on that

317
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:17,199
topic to get to such conclusion or maybe

318
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,920
it's because you've been conditioned to

319
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:21,279
believe it whether that be from your

320
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,959
parents your teachers or even your

321
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,120
friends then keep asking more questions

322
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:27,360
until you get to the bottom of your

323
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,199
beliefs to find out if they're rooted in

324
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,320
truth or they're rooted in and

325
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:33,560
conditioning did this entire sequence of

326
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,760
questions lead you to any conclusions

327
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,920
did it change any of your beliefs did

328
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,519
you realize anything new did you

329
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,199
actually make a change or is everything

330
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,199
just the same it is only through this

331
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:46,320
process that you are going to be able to

332
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:48,040
truly identify your limiting beliefs

333
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,399
that are a result from all the

334
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,920
conditioning the system has fed you your

335
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,079
entire life and it's only once you

336
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,160
identify these core limiting beliefs

337
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:59,800
that you can unwire them for good so

338
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,040
that you're finally ready to achieve

339
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:06,720
success this is the Socratic method of

340
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,120
getting to the truth now you want to

341
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,000
know the most interesting part about all

342
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,600
of this back in the day Socrates used

343
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,399
reason to discover and understand how

344
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,920
the world works and how to get to the

345
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,680
truth today the system aims to destroy

346
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,320
your reasoning because they don't want

347
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,120
you to find out how the world truly

348
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:27,279
works this is how they keep you a

349
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,639
product of the system but actually it's

350
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,120
not just today the as you already know

351
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,800
Socrates was executed and his execution

352
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,240
is often cited as a black stain on

353
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,720
Athenian democracy and used as a case

354
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,600
study of the tyranny of the State

355
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,760
against those who dare to challenge it

356
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,600
now what did he get executed for

357
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,760
corrupting the youth it was alleged that

358
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,800
he influenced the young men of Athens to

359
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,480
question and challenge traditional

360
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,320
values and beliefs I mean how big of a

361
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,160
crime is that right his method of

362
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,320
questioning everything including the

363
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,240
basis of Athenian traditions and beliefs

364
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,399
well that irritated many of the city's

365
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,279
leaders and thinkers he used to question

366
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,839
everything and everyone and some of the

367
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,000
most famous interactions were with the

368
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,360
prominent political figures of his time

369
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,120
you see by questioning them Socrates

370
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,160
often exposed that many of these

371
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,480
influential figures well they couldn't

372
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,720
adequately Define or understand the

373
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,040
virtues that they claimed to possess and

374
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,160
as you know by this point the last thing

375
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,959
that the rulers want you to do is

376
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,600
question the traditional values and

377
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,920
beliefs and above

378
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,360
else question them much less encourage

379
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:38,079
an entire generation of young people to

380
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,040
do the same and socrates's execution was

381
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,639
the starting point of the war that we're

382
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:46,320
still fighting to this day the war on

383
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,480
truth so what I want to do now is

384
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,000
exactly what Socrates did back then to

385
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,560
encourage the millions of people

386
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,440
watching this event I want you to

387
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,279
question everything because this very

388
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,639
same thing is happening today people who

389
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:02,839
encourage the young generations to think

390
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,440
for themselves and ask why certain

391
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:07,959
traditional systems and institutions

392
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,839
operate the way that they do they too

393
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:13,600
are getting digitally executed or

394
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,959
cancelled if you prefer and it is our

395
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,650
duty to fight against it so now it's

396
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,880
your turn to

397
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:26,560
[Music]

398
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:29,279
question 399 BC as you've seen one of

399
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,800
the most pivotal days on the war on took

400
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,839
place in that year socrates's trial I

401
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,920
mean his trial remains one of the most

402
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,639
famous judicial verdicts in history the

403
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,120
trial took place in a large Open Air

404
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,880
Hillside the pcks in the presence of a

405
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,079
jury consisting of 500 male citizens as

406
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,920
well as hundreds of citizens who were

407
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,759
there to watch one thing you may not

408
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,319
know is that one of those citizens

409
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:56,079
present was socrates's main Prodigy at

410
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:59,199
the time someone who you probably have

411
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,800
heard of before his name

412
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,959
Plato you see Plato was a student of

413
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,000
Socrates for almost 10 years at that

414
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:08,279
point he was introduced to the world of

415
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
philosophy through Socrates and was

416
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,639
deeply influenced by his method of

417
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,199
questioning you know the one I just

418
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:17,560
taught you Socrates was his mentor and

419
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:20,319
that day was the day that Plato's World

420
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,560
fell apart I mean really imagine this

421
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:25,360
Plato stood there and he witnessed his

422
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,839
mentor sticking to what he believed in

423
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,519
even in the face of death all because

424
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,360
Socrates had urged Athenians to think

425
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,279
critically about their beliefs and

426
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,399
values what a crime and very

427
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,839
understandably Plato was deeply affected

428
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,040
by the Athenian democracy's decision to

429
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,880
put his mentor to death I mean

430
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,360
everything he admired about Athens and

431
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,759
its political system was also killed on

432
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,199
that day which led him to do something

433
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,120
that changed the world as we know it

434
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:55,839
forever you see that was the end of

435
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,199
Socrates but that was the start of

436
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,079
something so much bigger so after the

437
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:02,440
tra atic experience of witnessing his

438
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,199
beloved Mentor be sentenced to death

439
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,160
Plato began to develop his ideas about

440
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:09,079
the nature of Injustice the role of the

441
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,559
individual within the state and the idea

442
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:15,319
of the good he went deep into physics

443
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,679
ethics psychology and education and this

444
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,799
ended up leading him to do something

445
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,120
that is still remembered to the state

446
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,439
the foundation of the academy in Athens

447
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,000
which would later be considered the

448
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,400
Western world's first University and

449
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,520
this really marked the real origin of

450
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,559
the education system and I'd say that is

451
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,880
what ignited the war for the truth I'd

452
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,960
say the biggest thing to notice here is

453
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,640
how the original education system

454
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,559
differed from the modern day education

455
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,320
system because it wasn't an education

456
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,559
system that came from the government it

457
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,400
was an education system that came from

458
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,720
the people it derived from their

459
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,600
frustrations towards the system now you

460
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,880
might be wondering but why is that so

461
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,799
important because it had your interests

462
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,520
in mind not the government's interests

463
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:00,000
and that's why its objective was to get

464
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,240
people to pursue the truth so that they

465
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
could become Outsiders themselves and

466
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,880
Achieve Freedom outside of the system

467
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,559
now compare that to the Prussian

468
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,480
schooling system from the 1700s the same

469
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:14,840
one that we still use to this day now as

470
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,720
you saw in the first episode education

471
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,679
is led by the government and if it's led

472
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,280
by the government whose interests do

473
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:23,919
they have in mind your interests or

474
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,919
their interests and this is where the

475
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,679
shift in power happened along the way

476
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,360
it's when education stopped being

477
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,799
educating yourself for your own

478
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,120
self-interest and started to be

479
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:36,840
educating yourself for the interests of

480
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,200
the ones in charge and today all

481
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,240
education is led by the government even

482
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,520
private institutions they still have to

483
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,600
follow a strict curriculum that is

484
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,240
imposed by the government and this is

485
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,520
really how they create an illusion of

486
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,480
choice for you oh you can choose this

487
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,159
course or this University or this degree

488
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,880
this is how they trick you because at

489
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:57,799
the end of the day if their education is

490
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,000
coming from the government it is all

491
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:02,799
different paths that lead to the same

492
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,240
destination which is you being a product

493
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,280
of the system and that is why we steered

494
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,400
away from education being based on the

495
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,159
pursuit of the truth because they don't

496
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,880
want you to know the truth now have you

497
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:17,960
ever heard the saying that history

498
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,559
repeats itself well it turns out that

499
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,080
Plato 2 became a mentor himself to

500
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,559
another very bright mind of the human

501
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,320
race which you probably have heard about

502
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,679
as well his name was Aristotle and

503
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,960
Aristotle 2 cre his own School the

504
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,400
lysium and it's interesting to note that

505
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,840
the search for truth was so ingrained in

506
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,360
the roots of their core values that each

507
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,120
generation created their own version of

508
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,919
the truth I mean it started with

509
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,520
Socrates and his whole concept that he

510
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:47,400
knew nothing and then Plato died deeper

511
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,280
into metaphysics which he considered to

512
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,559
be his truth and diverged from the

513
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,400
original ideas of his mentor he believed

514
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:54,919
that true knowledge can only be grasped

515
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,080
through reason and intellect and that

516
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:59,240
the true reality lies in the realm of

517
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,400
the ideas which exists beyond the

518
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,880
physical world Aristotle on the other

519
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,840
hand well he believed that knowledge

520
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,120
starts from the material world and he

521
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,480
really emphasized observation

522
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,720
classification and Analysis really

523
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,919
laying the groundwork for Empirical

524
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,120
research and the scientific method and

525
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,760
now we fast forward a few years here and

526
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,880
get to 343 BCE Aristotle was now one of

527
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,080
the most respected intellectuals of his

528
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,760
age and he received an invitation you

529
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:30,200
see King Philip II from Macedonia wanted

530
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,880
Aristotle to Mentor his son someone who

531
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,120
you most likely have heard about before

532
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,559
as well someone who later in his 20s

533
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,480
went on to conquer more cities more

534
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:43,200
countries and more territories than any

535
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:47,080
other man or Army had ever done before

536
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,559
him his name was Alexander but you

537
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,159
probably know him as Alexander the Great

538
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:53,440
now at the time King Philip II well he

539
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,000
already had the choice of sending his

540
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,679
son to school in Macedonia so why did he

541
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,799
choose to appoint someone as his son's

542
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,280
Mentor instead because he wanted to

543
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,360
provide an Elite Education for the

544
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,440
future heir to his throne and he knew

545
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,520
that the best way to do this was by

546
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,799
appointing a successful renowned

547
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:15,360
individual as the mentor for his son so

548
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,960
I told you this entire story to get to

549
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:23,679
this point which is do you see a trend

550
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:26,000
here Socrates Plato Aristotle Alexander

551
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,400
the Great you kind of notice something

552
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,640
here you know did they have something in

553
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,120
common well for one they were all

554
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,240
independent critical thinkers despite

555
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,760
the Deep influence of their mentors they

556
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,080
all diverged from the initial

557
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,520
philosophies that they were taught and

558
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,000
why is that because they were taught to

559
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,440
be critical thinkers first they put the

560
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,080
search for their own truth above

561
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,360
everything else and that as you know is

562
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,279
the first principle of the outsider

563
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,240
second I mean have you ever asked

564
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:58,440
yourself how come there were so many

565
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,120
Geniuses and incredible individuals back

566
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,840
then so why is that not the case anymore

567
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,520
nowadays it's because they all mentored

568
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,880
each other it's not as if they just

569
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,039
became great by themselves they all had

570
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,400
a great mind that taught them the ways

571
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:15,240
and forged their greatness it's very

572
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:17,279
simple greatness creates greatness I

573
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,080
mean history is super confusing so you

574
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:22,000
hear all of these names and you just

575
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,440
think oh my they were all Geniuses back

576
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,320
then thinking that they were all

577
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:30,279
separate people but no they were all

578
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,440
intimately connected I mean they were

579
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:34,880
all learning from each other it's not as

580
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,080
if these Geniuses these Outsiders were

581
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,919
just created out of thin air they were

582
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,720
created in part by the ones who mentored

583
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,520
them you see the way that education

584
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,240
worked back then was that you as a

585
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,600
father would entrust your child's

586
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,640
education to a mentor that you

587
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,760
personally considered wise and this

588
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,039
Mentor would teach the children what he

589
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,400
considered essential for them to become

590
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:58,480
wise citizens and critical thinkers

591
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,919
themselves and even after the the Romans

592
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,240
conquered Greece wealthy Roman families

593
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:05,679
would still employ educated Greek

594
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,039
intellectuals to Mentor their children I

595
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,799
mean think about it why would they let

596
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,480
their own War enemies Mentor their

597
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:14,080
children because they knew that having a

598
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,279
successful Mentor was not one of the

599
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,840
ways to make your child successful it

600
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:23,799
was the only way and this is the third

601
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,880
principle of the outsider have a mentor

602
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:27,559
because history shows us that's the

603
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,760
greatest way to ensure you'll achieve

604
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:31,279
success u in life and that's why every

605
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,440
single one of The Outsiders I mentioned

606
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,440
throughout this video had

607
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,080
mentors listen at the end of the day we

608
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,039
all want the same thing freedom to be

609
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,279
able to do whatever we want with

610
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,559
whomever we want now for you that might

611
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,400
mean to be able to wake up one day and

612
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:53,840
gather all of your best friends for a

613
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:57,640

you you want to call the world your home

616
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,360
and you want to switch places every few

617
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,880
months a very tranquil Japanese zen

tasting wines and enjoying the Italian

629
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,039
sun or you fund the building of a school

630
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:37,240
in a remote country like I personally

631
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:39,880
started doing in Nepal in 2019 ensuring

632
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,720
education for generations to come listen

633
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,320
whatever that experience may be for you

634
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,760
we all have different aspirations and

635
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,919
goals in life at the end of the day I

636
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,399
call it having financial location and

637
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,960
time freedom and today the reality is

638
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:54,240
that less than 1% of the world's

639
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,279
population have managed to achieve these

640
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,919
three types of freedom and if you want

641
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:01,200
to be part of this 1% yourself you need

642
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,039
to ask yourself how do you become truly

643
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,120
free is what you're doing today going to

644
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:08,120
lead you to becoming truly free if not

645
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,200
why are you doing it then maybe it's

646
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,279
something temporary maybe it's the only

647
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,520
option you currently have and that's

648
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:15,960
totally fine listen if you're not yet in

649
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,279
a path that will take you to True

650
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,880
Freedom it's not your fault as you

651
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:22,120
already know at this point the

652
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,840
conditioning Factory has conditioned you

653
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:27,200
to be there now the problem is when you

654
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,720
don't ask these questions when you never

655
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,039
realize why you're doing what you're

656
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,039
doing in the first place and if having

657
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,279
these three types of freedom is

658
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,520
something that you aspire to have you

659
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,960
have to ask yourself then what are the

660
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,799
things that I need to learn in order to

661
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,880
achieve such Freedom you see the reason

662
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,960
the ancient Greeks started to study

663
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,279
science philosophy mathematics was not

664
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,360
because they wanted to be mathematicians

665
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:54,520
or philosophers but rather because they

666
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,600
considered those as necessary

667
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,120
characteristics to make you a critical

668
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,600
thinker and as a a consequence make you

669
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,640
pursue and Achieve true Freedom

670
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,760
achieving true Freedom was always the

671
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,279
ultimate goal of Education ever since

672
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,120
ancient Greece now from the moment that

673
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:12,880
the system tells you what you need to

674
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,919
study this freedom is restrained you see

675
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,960
the first idea of a school curriculum

676
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:18,679
was developed during the Middle Ages

677
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,919
based on a lot the same principles that

678
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:23,440
they had in ancient Greece they called

679
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:25,559
it liberal arts the curriculum that they

680
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,679
developed back then which was taught in

681
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,279
Western universities that developed

682
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,480
civilization throughout an entire

683
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,360
Millennium up until the Renaissance and

684
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,159
the goal of it was pretty simple teach

685
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,960
people a group of subjects that would

686
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,919
allow them to achieve spiritual and

687
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,360
intellectual freedom and the freedoms

688
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:43,760
were divided into three inferior and

689
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,120
four Superior disciplines the inferior

690
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,559
ones also known as the Trivium were

691
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:51,360
grammar to decode the world we live in

692
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:53,480
and communicate through words dialectic

693
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,960
to compare different perceptions and

694
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,880
evolve in the search for truth rethoric

695
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,000
to express our observations and

696
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,159
conclusions in a persuasive Manner and

697
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,960
the superior ones also known as the

698
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,840
quadrum and these were arithmetic to

699
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:11,120
quantify the world we know geometry to

700
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,440
put quantities into space music to fit

701
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,440
the numbers in time and astronomy to

702
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,279
understand the influence of the stars in

703
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,399
space you see they developed a

704
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:22,679
curriculum that when followed would

705
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,640
create individuals who could pursue and

706
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,600
Achieve Freedom so if you two want to

707
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,399
become free what do you need you need

708
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,760
need to follow a curriculum and

709
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:32,799
obviously not the same curriculum that

710
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,919
they followed back then because times

711
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,760
have changed a lot and so have the means

712
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,360
through which you achieve freedom but

713
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,440
you need to follow a curriculum that is

714
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,799
based on the same principles and I know

715
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,799
what you're going to say now oh eeman

716
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,080
but there's no such thing as following a

717
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,600
curriculum and becoming free and that's

718
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,679
true the curriculum itself won't make

719
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,080
you free but it will instill in you all

720
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,519
the knowledge you need to have about

721
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,039
yourself and the world you live in in

722
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:59,360
order for you to be able to pursue

723
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,320
freedom and here's the thing if you

724
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,919
think that there's no such thing as a

725
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,000
curriculum that you're going to follow

726
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:07,600
and that will make you free just think

727
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,679
about this in the 1700s the prussians

728
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,840
created a curriculum that was able to

729
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:15,880
First indoctrinate entire generations to

730
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:18,880
obey comply and believe what they were

731
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,600
told without ever even questioning them

732
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,880
then they use that same curriculum to

733
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,760
create a legion of mindless obedient

734
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,720
Factory workers to work in Rockefeller

735
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,799
oil industry then they use that same

736
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,799
curriculum to get millions of people to

737
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:38,559
happily get hundreds of thousands of

738
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:40,279
dollars in debt just to get a useless

739
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,559
piece of paper that doesn't even

740
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:45,760
guarantee them any type of work or

741
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:48,720
income this is how they got ahead in the

742
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,919
war on truth so trust me that's the

743
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,240
power of following the right curriculum

744
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:54,440
I mean really think about it which one

745
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,039
do you think is harder to accomplish to

746
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:59,360
completely remove the Free Will of

747
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:02,120
entire ire Generations around the world

748
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,360
creating Legions of mindless obedient

749
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:06,760
Factory workers and getting them to pay

750
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:09,600
hundreds of thousands of dollars for the

751
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:12,279
privilege to do so or getting someone to

752
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,480
make $10,000 a month listen the truth is

753
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:15,320
as long as you follow the right

754
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,919
curriculum you can achieve whatever you

755
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,720
want whether that's for your best

756
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:22,039
interest or someone else's interest and

757
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,120
that is the fourth principle of the

758
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:28,640
outsider find out what curriculum will

759
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,720
set you free and I mean really find out

760
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,720
exactly what you need to be able to do

761
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,960
how you need to think and what you need

762
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,840
to do in order to be free analyze the

763
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,240
world around you look to the successful

764
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,320
people of our time how did they get

765
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,200
there and to make that easier for you in

766
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,600
episode 3 I'm going to reveal exactly

767
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:51,919
how I crafted the curriculum that Set Me

768
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,919
Free as well as tens of thousands of

769
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,600
others now interestingly enough the

770
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,159
fifth and last principle of the outsider

771
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,000
doesn't come from ancient Greece but

772
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,600
from their biggest Rivals the Spartans

773
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,720
you see around the same time that all of

774
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,279
this was happening in ancient Greece a

775
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,840
guy named lerus of Sparta reinvented the

776
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:16,720
Spartan Education and Training System he

777
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,519
called it the ago this was the system

778
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,880
that led the Spartans to dominate

779
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:22,679
everyone who they met in the battlefield

780
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,480
and allowed them to remain undefeated

781
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:27,880
for over 150 years and this entire

782
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,840
system was based on one principle that

783
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,440
healthy disciplined able-bodied

784
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,480
individuals are the key to a successful

785
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,960
and functional society and here's how

786
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,720
the system worked one man was chosen to

787
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,679
be in charge of the boys as their ponis

788
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,840
as they called it their mentor and it

789
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,640
was his job to make sure that the

790
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,480
Spartans became loyal resourceful

791
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,960
disciplined and accustomed to extensive

792
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,760
physical activity and the Spartans also

793
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,880
understood that if they wanted their

794
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,320
citizens to become the most successful

795
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,840
and unbeatable individuals there was

796
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:02,440
only one way to achieve that by having

797
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,840
mentors guiding the way for their entire

798
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,880
generation that's why being aonomus was

799
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,399
considered an incredibly important role

800
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,279
for the Spartans because at the end of

801
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:13,080
the day they were responsible for

802
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,240
bringing up the next generation of

803
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,559
Spartans that's why this position was

804
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,200
only open to those who were eligible for

805
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:22,240
election to the highest offices you see

806
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,320
they wouldn't choose anyone to be the

807
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,279
mentors of their next Generation they

808
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,880
would only choose their most talented

809
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:31,120
Spartan individual ual to take this role

810
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,399
because they knew that only greatness

811
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,320
can create greatness so if they were to

812
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,399
have any mediocre citizens to be the

813
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,399
mentor of their next Generation Well in

814
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,320
that case what would their next

815
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:44,120
Generation turn out to become a

816
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,039
generation of mediocre Spartans they

817
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,799
understood that the level of success an

818
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:50,720
individual achieves is directly related

819
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,639
to how successful the people mentoring

820
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,679
them are now at this point as an

821
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:56,399
outsider in developing yourself you

822
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,000
already understand this principle but

823
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,200
that's not why I brought of the Spartans

824
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,120
here you see the system that Sparta

825
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,480
created had another very interesting

826
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,960
concept the concept of enduring through

827
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,880
intense hardship and the second step of

828
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,399
the ago system was all about turning

829
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,519
students into individuals who can endure

830
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:16,880
hardship they would only give students

831
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:19,000
one cloak for the entire year and made

832
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,799
them walk Barefoot to strengthen their

833
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,120
feet you see they believe that if their

834
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,399
feet were properly accustomed they could

835
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,919
run faster and jump higher than anyone

836
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,559
in Footwear they were also taught on how

837
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,440
to not fight with weapons and March in

838
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:35,080
full silence and the mentors would

839
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,760
ensure that they were always hungry to

840
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,840
some degree as well why to put them into

841
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,880
a Perpetual state of discomfort because

842
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,440
discomfort breeds discipline and

843
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,519
discipline forges greatness it was all

844
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,720
about being a strong and disciplined

845
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,960
individual a disciplined individual who

846
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,880
can resist the Temptations that life

847
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,360
throws their way and live a life of

848
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,760
delayed gratification instead of instant

849
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,000
gratification and has an extremely high

850
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,799
likeliness of becoming successful and

851
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,880
listen history proved this not only with

852
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:08,519
the Spartans but with so many different

853
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,919
cultures and societies that operated

854
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:13,360
under this same principle and that is

855
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:16,600
why this is the fifth principle of the

856
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,000
outsider seek intense hardship to forge

857
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,159
discipline and self-control because it

858
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,120
is only through intense hardship that

859
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:25,399
you will be able to create the best and

860
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,240
most successful version of yourself and

861
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:29,799
on episode 3 I will show you the the

862
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,399
exact protocol I use to ensure that I

863
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:34,720
develop and maintain the highest levels

864
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,200
of discipline and self-control that's

865
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,880
needed for me to be able to properly

866
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:42,200
manage my portfolio of eight and multi-a

867
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,840
figure companies now the ago system was

868
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,559
focused specifically on young adults why

869
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,600
because they saw the young adults of

870
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:52,880
Sparta as the city's greatest assets and

871
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,559
they were the ones that led Sparta to

872
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,039
150 years without defeats and I know

873
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:59,440
that more than likely you are a young

874
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,720
adult yourself so truly understand that

875
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,080
these are your greatest years the years

876
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,000
that will either make you successful or

877
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,800
ENT trap you into mediocrity for the

878
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,480
rest of your life so please make sure

879
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,960
you make the most out of them because

880
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,960
your time is

881
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,520
limited and all of this brings us back

882
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,720
to today and it begs the question aren't

883
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,240
those principles outdated and the answer

884
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,320
is today they're actually more relevant

885
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,240
than ever they're not only Timeless

886
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,639
principles they're the principles that

887
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,879
are most needed in today's world and the

888
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:38,240
ones who apply them in their lives will

889
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:40,079
experience the same levels of success

890
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,320
that The Outsiders who applied them back

891
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,919
in the days did but you don't have much

892
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,839
time left to apply them in fact this

893
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,520
might even be your last chance and if

894
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:52,280
that sounds very intense or over

895
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,639
dramatic let me tell you why we are one

896
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,960
step away from the war on Truth taking

897
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,680
its final form don't get it twisted our

898
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,200
side is losing and we're only a few

899
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,960
chess moves away from the worst possible

900
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,520
outcome which is stage 4 conditioning

901
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,000
you'll remember that stage four

902
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,800
conditioning is what the conditioning

903
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,280
Factory has been aiming for this whole

904
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,280
time stage four conditioning is when

905
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,599
they have complete control over the

906
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,280
truth and you are stripped of all

907
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:21,359
freedom and all Choice and then it won't

908
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,760
matter if you find out what your truth

909
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,520
is because they will completely control

910
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,000
the truth it doesn't matter if you

911
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,440
decide to follow a curriculum that that

912
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,400
has the potential of setting you free at

913
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,480
Freedom is not a thing anymore and the

914
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,839
conditioning Factory is working at Full

915
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,000
Steam to make that happen now you might

916
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,839
think that this dystopia is a product of

917
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,280
Science Fiction that something like this

918
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,240
would never happen in real life I mean

919
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,079
surely the government can't have total

920
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,960
control of the truth but they can and

921
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:52,960
it's already happening not once not

922
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,040
twice but many times and it's about to

923
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,359
happen again I mean just think about how

924
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,240
every dictator runs their country

925
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,880
is through stage four conditioning and

926
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:04,359
soon this dystopia may become reality in

927
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,480
the west communist China and these other

928
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:10,240
regimes weren't simply based on Marxism

929
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,880
they were also authoritarian States and

930
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,040
the first step towards authoritarianism

931
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,640
is limiting Free Speech which is exactly

932
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,359
what we're seeing today according to a

933
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,160
recent survey conducted by the KO

934
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:25,920
Institute over 60% of people today say

935
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,839
that they are afraid of saying what they

936
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,720
believe because of the current political

937
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:32,839
climate does that look like free speech

938
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,599
to you if majority of people are not

939
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:36,720
comfortable in saying what they believe

940
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:39,480
to be true and this is how it all

941
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:42,079
relates back to what we're living today

942
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,480
right now you see the new philosophy

943
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,240
that is sweeping across our society has

944
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,920
its roots deeply fastened in Marxist

945
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:52,040
ideology it's the new wave of wokeism

946
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,079
that you see everywhere and this is

947
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,720
exactly what led us here because in

948
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,960
efforts of creating a culture of

949
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:00,040
inclusion they have created a culture of

950
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,960
intolerance the very thing that all of

951
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,400
these groups swear to fight against

952
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,560
diversity of thought has been replaced

953
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:08,200
by exclusion of ideas and freedom of

954
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,079
speech has eroded entirely and if you

955
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,480
don't conform if you don't say the right

956
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,599
thing you will fail that class or you

957
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,680
will be fired and this is the essence of

958
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:20,640
cancel culture it is a world based on

959
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,760
fear no different from communist China

960
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,200
fear is the control mechanism and it's

961
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,119
enforced by Wall Street the universities

962
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,960
and the cult-like followers of these

963
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,240
ideologies because if you don't conform

964
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:35,800
you will be ostracized and once you

965
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,319
cross that line there's no going back

966
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,760
long story short it might look like a

967
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:42,000
far-fetched example but know that today

968
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,480
if you live in a country like USA Canada

969
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,960
Australia Germany UK or any other

970
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,480
American or European country in fact we

971
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,480
really are all one conditioning stage

972
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,119
away from a country like China we are

973
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,160
already in stage three and making leap

974
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,000
towards stage 4 conditioning and there

975
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:00,079
is only one thing that can stop that

976
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,440
from happening the truth education was

977
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,839
originally based on finding the truth

978
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,640
Aristotle Plato Marcus aelius they all

979
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:10,079
lived in a system where the search for

980
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,160
truth and thus Freedom was the number

981
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,839
one goal the problem is somewhere along

982
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,920
the journey there was a shift in powers

983
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,240
and the ones who got to power they

984
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,760
stopped caring about the interest of

985
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,640
their people and they started to put

986
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,359
their self-interest first they didn't

987
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,200
care if that meant destroying the very

988
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:26,800
principles that produce citizens that

989
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,480
push Society forward because that's not

990
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,240
what their goal was their goal was

991
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,079
simple to grow and perpetuate their

992
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,800
power and control and they figured

993
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,359
something critical having their

994
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,560
population know the truth was the

995
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,480
greatest risk to their power because if

996
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,319
the population was able to think for

997
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,920
themselves and figure out what the truth

998
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,800
is well then they wouldn't be able to

999
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,920
lie and manipulate people and that is

1000
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,440
how they plan to impose stage 4

1001
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,119
conditioning upon us where you won't

1002
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,520
even be able to control your own truth

1003
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,440
anymore because you won't have choices

1004
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,760
on the other hand if we manage to take

1005
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:59,240
back control over the truth and get it

1006
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:02,000
to as many people as possible we will

1007
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,480
experience the great rescue where the

1008
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,160
principles that once created the

1009
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,760
greatest Minds that have ever stepped in

1010
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,599
this world will be brought back to life

1011
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,560
and with it we'll get back to the

1012
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:15,920
origins of education education from the

1013
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,599
people to the people with your own

1014
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,960
interest in mind instead of the

1015
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,599
government's hidden interests and it all

1016
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,359
depends on us they were fighting the

1017
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:27,640
same war and followed the book on how to

1018
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,160
win it so much must we we have the

1019
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,560
principles laid out by the greatest

1020
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,440
Outsiders that have come before us so

1021
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,920
now it's our turn to become Outsiders

1022
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,000
ourselves by rescuing the same five

1023
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,720
principles and adopting them into our

1024
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,920
own lives I have given you the five lost

1025
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,400
principles to become free and Achieve

1026
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,920
success in whatever you do and on

1027
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,280
episode 3 I will show you exactly how I

1028
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,760
rescued these principles myself and

1029
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,680
implemented them in my own personal life

1030
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,920
which ultimately led me to the success

1031
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:59,839
that I have today and how you you too

1032
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,680
can rescue them in your life so if

1033
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,000
becoming a top 1% man is something that

1034
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,800
you aspire to what I need you to do is

1035
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,680
to turn on the alarm Bell for the

1036
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,880
premiere of the third episode by

1037
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,599
clicking the link in the pin comment

1038
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,560
it's going to go live on Monday at 5:00

1039
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,400
p.m. UK time in my opinion this will be

1040
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,640
the best video of the entire series

1041
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,839
because it will show in practice what it

1042
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,800
takes to become an outsider revealing

1043
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,640
exactly how I did it until then I have

1044
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,240
one mission for you these are our five

1045
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,319
lost principles number one establish

1046
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,079
what truth means for you the second

1047
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,520
evaluate your current beliefs and figure

1048
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,760
out where your limiting beliefs come

1049
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,880
from number three have a mentor number

1050
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,599
four figure out what curriculum will set

1051
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,319
you free and number five seek intense

1052
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,640
hardship to forge discipline and

1053
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:49,079
self-control we already tackled how to

1054
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,520
find your truth and establish your

1055
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:53,680
beliefs so what I want you to do now is

1056
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,800
to think about the third principle think

1057
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,280
about this Who currently is your mentor

1058
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,119
whether you want it or not you are

1059
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,000
always learning from someone and your

1060
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:03,640
success will always be limited by the

1061
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,280
level of success from who you're

1062
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:09,400
learning from so who are you currently

1063
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,920
learning from do you even have a mentor

1064
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,319
and if not even Plato Aristotle and

1065
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,720
Alexander the Great needed mentors what

1066
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:19,119
makes you think that you don't need one

1067
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,920
and is your current Mentor going to lead

1068
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,680
you to the level of Freedom you aspired

1069
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:26,960
to get to or do you need a new one so

1070
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:29,119
with all of that being said I'll see you

1071
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,119
on

1072
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,880
Monday
