1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
so you want to make your first million

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,600
but let me take a guess of what your day

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,700
looks like you wake up you grab your

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,740
phone you open Tick Tock and start

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,900
scrolling for 30 minutes before you

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,940
convince yourself to go downstairs you

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,680
then spend 20 minutes deciding and

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,260
preparing what you want to eat for

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,439
breakfast you then sit at your desk and

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,240
proceed to spend the next three hours

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,880
watching self-help podcasts thinking

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,900
that maybe if you just watch one more

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:34,200
that maybe you'll finally be successful

14
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:36,120
that is absolute or maybe

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,640
you're one of those self-help junkies

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,239
that's a step above so you wake up at

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,300
6am and you start your 15-step morning

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,420
routine that lasts four hours and by the

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,640
end of it you're so tired you need a nap

20
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,260
ladies and gentlemen both of these are

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,180
totally wrong so in today's video I'm

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,879
gonna reveal to you the seven

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,340
productivity hacks you need to make your

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,379
first million dollars now I want you to

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,420
know that I'm coming up on my 10th year

26
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,760
as an entrepreneur so I have tried

27
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,740
everything whatever Routine Morning

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,680
Routine all this BS supplement

29
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,960
biohacking ball like I've tried it all

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,580
so I can genuinely from ball my heart

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,799
tell you what works and what doesn't

32
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,479
work now the first productivity hack is

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,140
something that I publicly talked about

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,299
in 2021 when I uploaded a free module

35
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,100
from one of my paid programs back then

36
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,460
but I've actually been using this tool

37
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,380
for many many years and the tool is

38
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,140
called unhooked now here's the thing

39
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,240
YouTube is entertainment it is not

40
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,220
education and you need to view it that

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,220
way because in life you get ahead by

42
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,799
applying not learning listen it is

43
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,380
incredibly incredibly important to learn

44
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,020
learn as much as you can but it's far

45
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,200
more important to apply that information

46
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,119
even my videos I want you to view my

47
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,040
videos when you watch one of my videos I

48
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,720
don't want you to go away and think oh I

49
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,640
accomplished something look at me I'm so

50
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,220
happy with myself I want you to view my

51
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,560
videos as an interesting Viewpoint and

52
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,840
interesting perspective from someone who

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,580
has walked the path very publicly I've

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,800
been documenting everything for eight

55
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,500
years now on YouTube that has walked the

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,720
path that you want to walk but none of

57
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,599
it will have any effect whatsoever

58
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,459
unless you apply it now the thing is

59
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,500
YouTube is a very very smart platform

60
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,239
and it can be a very dangerous platform

61
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,640
because sure you have interesting

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,440
educational but remember view my content

63
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,540
as entertaining and by the way I want

64
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,980
you to view most books out there in the

65
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,040
exact same way because most books what

66
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,660
it is it's 15 pages of gold and then 300

67
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,879
pages of fluff because they can't sell

68
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,940
you a 15-page book and people will pay

69
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,400
12 for that even though it's really only

70
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,840
15 pages that are valuable but listen

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,280
that's just the way the world goes so as

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,200
long as when you watch my YouTube videos

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,720
when you read a book you look at that as

74
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,160
entertainment as downtime stuff really

75
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,200
the only thing that I would consider

76
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,599
proper learning is when you know exactly

77
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,819
what you need to do and you're educating

78
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,260
yourself on how to do it let's say

79
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,599
there's an aspect of your online

80
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,280
business or your Online Career that you

81
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,560
know you need to work on in order to get

82
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,360
ahead well then immersing yourself in

83
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,819
that specific topic that's education

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,980
just watching a podcast or reading a

85
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:16,200
book because you think that it might be

86
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,760
useful to you that is very dangerous and

87
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,920
you need to look at that as

88
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,900
entertainment and not education so

89
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,300
getting back to YouTube there is some

90
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,220
amazing information here on YouTube and

91
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,500
in fact some educational content here on

92
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,300
YouTube that will help you fix a

93
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,800
specific problem in your life you know

94
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,300
let's say for example you're running a

95
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,800
marathon the best thing you can do of

96
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,540
course is get a coach that's going to

97
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,459
work with you maybe even get a paid

98
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,440
program that's going to go hey here's

99
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,879
the plan in month one you do this month

100
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,560
two you do this month three you do that

101
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,360
but if you don't have the funds to do it

102
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,540
well then you can learn a lot on YouTube

103
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,099
but that is real intentional education

104
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,019
you're going on YouTube and you're going

105
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:54,060
hey I want to learn the scaler or I want

106
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,920
to complete this thing how do I do it

107
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,900
can I get as much information about this

108
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,760
thing that is intentional whereas when

109
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,739
you go on the YouTube home feed that's

110
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,060
not intention at all all that the

111
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,099
algorithm is doing is just trying to

112
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,900
pull you in and try to grasp and try to

113
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:08,700
take your attention so that's why I've

114
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,439
been saying for years and years that

115
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,140
people need to download Chrome

116
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:15,000
extensions or applications like unhooked

117
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,040
what it does is it hides a lot of the

118
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,019
things that are unimportant to you here

119
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,180
on YouTube so on the settings I want you

120
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,800
to turn on hide home feed so that way

121
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,660
when you go on YouTube you won't see

122
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,820
your home feed I want you to turn off

123
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,919
the side recommendations so to hide the

124
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,660
video sidebar and I also want you to

125
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,340
hide the comments so the only thing that

126
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,720
is left is your subscription box because

127
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,699
once again you need to be very very

128
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,020
intentional with that of the people that

129
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,000
you subscribe to and once again your

130
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,440
subscription box can be a place for

131
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,660
light entertainment but I don't want you

132
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,979
going on the home page and now all of a

133
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,419
sudden you're recommending a video that

134
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:48,180
you think is going to help you but once

135
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,680
again it is not intentional education

136
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,259
now I also want to make something very

137
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,960
clear I am literally shooting myself in

138
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:57,840
the foot by telling you this but I don't

139
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,160
care I want you to get ahead in life and

140
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,860
by the way if that means that you watch

141
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,780
less of my content or what happens for a

142
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,520
lot of people I've noticed is maybe my

143
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,259
content is beneficial to you at a

144
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,180
beginning stage in life and then you get

145
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:10,620
to more intermediate and my content is a

146
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,000
little less applicable and the funny

147
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,220
thing I've seen is once you actually get

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,780
to an exceptional stage of life my

149
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,520
content becomes relevant again because

150
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,840
you start to look at what I'm saying in

151
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,699
the Viewpoint from a much different

152
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,680
perspective of someone who's already

153
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,600
made it and now you can kind of start to

154
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,580
understand why I say the things that I

155
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,560
say so really the reason that I want to

156
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,780
make all of this clear to you is that

157
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,120
you need to be extremely diligent with

158
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,400
where you put your attention so the

159
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,919
first productivity hack is I want you to

160
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,720
download unhooked and get rid of any

161
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,240
stupid recommendations no stupid

162
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,639
comments no sidebar reclaim your

163
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,139
attention and your focus now real quick

164
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,240
before we get into the next part of the

165
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:51,479
video I get so many people asking for

166
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,160
specific Q A's about business about how

167
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:54,900
to start your online career and I'm

168
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,639
gonna be honest here on YouTube I don't

169
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,500
really speak to people's specific

170
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,060
situations and on my personal Instagram

171
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,320
like for me that's just like a joke that

172
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,960
that's just where I post like Photo

173
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,699
dumps from trips and holidays and life

174
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,320
basically but that's why I created a

175
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,080
separate private Instagram page called

176
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,120
talk with Iman it is entirely free and

177
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,340
that's actually where I aim to do a q a

178
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,560
so answering your guys's questions once

179
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,600
a week as I said it's free so a lot of

180
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,940
weeks I miss it I'm human I have a lot

181
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,919
of things going on but I try my best to

182
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,080
do weekly so if you ever had any more

183
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,479
business specific or making money online

184
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,000
specific questions go ahead and follow

185
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,979
that account so the second and probably

186
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,680
most important productivity hack is that

187
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,720
I want you to plan the day the night

188
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,580
before now I know it sounds too simple

189
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,139
to be true but that's why most people

190
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,300
don't do it you know there's something

191
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,340
very special that goes on overnight but

192
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,380
when you have set your intention you

193
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,300
know when you go into the day with true

194
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,740
intention when you set your intention

195
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,660
the night before something very special

196
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,340
happens while you're sleeping I've

197
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,919
definitely noticed that now it can be as

198
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,720
simple as three tasks three main things

199
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,960
for the day now back in the day from

200
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,639
2016 to around 2019 2020 when I was

201
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,139
really driving the business for it I

202
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,639
didn't have the leadership that I have

203
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,380
in my different companies and the

204
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,000
business partners and the CEOs that I

205
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,340
have in my different companies I used to

206
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,440
plan my day hour by hour so literally

207
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,120
hour by hour what am I doing these days

208
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,860
of course I've got my calendar I've got

209
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,600
my assistant and things are penciled in

210
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,979
but apart from that I like to free flow

211
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,780
for me the most important thing is

212
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:23,699
looking at my calendar knowing what I

213
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,900
have the next day put in place whether

214
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,720
that be important business calls

215
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,699
important meetings certain duties that I

216
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,440
need to tend to and for me it's as

217
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,819
simple as writing down three to five

218
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,180
things I need to accomplish that day

219
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:39,180
it's that simple but I promise you it

220
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,220
works so try it tonight tonight just

221
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,220
very simply write three to five things

222
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,720
down tonight before tomorrow starts and

223
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,900
you'll see your brain starts working

224
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,639
overnight and you go into tomorrow with

225
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,979
real intention now the third

226
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,500
productivity hack is to wear the same

227
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:57,360
outfits now hear me out I believe that

228
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,979
when you leave the house or let's say

229
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,840
you're doing uh you know you've got a

230
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,280
meeting or you've got some recording or

231
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,720
something like that I believe in

232
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,220
dressing the part now by the way

233
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,960
dressing the part can mean different

234
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,060
things to different people I like to

235
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,620
dress smart casual so when I leave the

236
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,720
house a lot of times I've got a Blazer

237
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,940
maybe Blazer trousers you know some

238
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,860
smart casual shoes sometimes I'm even

239
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,539
wearing suits you know for meetings and

240
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,520
stuff like that now I feel like if I

241
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,900
came and recorded YouTube videos and I

242
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,220
was wearing a suit people would just

243
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,780
find that a little stranger you know

244
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,740
when I've got my zoom meetings I feel

245
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,120
like that would be a little strange

246
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,680
because I don't have a physical office

247
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,940
that I need to go to every day so

248
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,379
dressing the park can mean different

249
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,899
things to you and I definitely believe

250
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:35,580
that in my early younger years dressing

251
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,959
the part and actually over dressing I

252
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,120
used to overdress pretty much to

253
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,800
everything really helped me because when

254
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,140
you're young some people will already

255
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,760
try to discredit you in business so if

256
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,860
you're there with a you know a hoodie

257
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,420
and big graphic tees and this and that

258
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,260
you're not doing yourself any favors so

259
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,540
definitely especially when you're

260
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,700
younger overdress but when you're home

261
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,320
you know when I'm home and I know that

262
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,899
all I have is some Zoom meetings I've

263
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,399
got calls all day stuff like that I

264
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:01,560
pretty much wear the same thing every

265
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,000
single day now variations of it most of

266
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,860
the time I don't wear big crazy colors

267
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,959
when I'm at the home for me it's simple

268
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,600
it's the same few pairs of jeans

269
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,760
trousers pretty much the same shoes and

270
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,500
the same brand t-shirt in various

271
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,480
different colors and this really just

272
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,920
makes your life a lot easier and we're

273
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,300
gonna get to another point that I want

274
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,100
to talk about a little later on another

275
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,019
productivity hack but it's just

276
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,519
something that you no longer need to

277
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,440
think about when you've just got a

278
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,000
simple brand of shoes that you wear at

279
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,399
home and by the way I know this sounds

280
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,560
funny but I personally prefer to wear

281
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,700
shoes in the house I wear shoes in the

282
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,740
house and the reason that is is because

283
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,779
because I I don't go to an office I feel

284
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,880
like when I'm wearing shoes I know that

285
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:40,320
okay it's time to be serious because for

286
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,260
me to walk around the house with like

287
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,120
flip-flops or sandals or shoeless I feel

288
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,860
like that's stuff I like to do when I'm

289
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,839
not working or I'm in my off time or

290
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,399
whatever but when I'm in flow when I'm

291
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,779
in the zone I like to wear shoes in the

292
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,760
house because for me it just means that

293
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,680
okay I know I'm doing some serious work

294
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,480
here make sure it's not sweatpants and

295
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,980
make sure it's not sloppy clothing you

296
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,480
know take yourself seriously now when

297
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,100
you have external meetings or even if

298
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,260
it's a zoom call then you can kind of

299
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,480
dress up a little bit more depending on

300
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,220
the situation but when you're just at

301
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,800
your computer for eight hours working

302
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,240
grinding on a singular task or a few

303
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,860
tasks and you know you're not really

304
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,959
interacting too much with the outside

305
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,940
world just have sort of your plain

306
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:20,040
uniform that you go to every day now the

307
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,839
fourth productivity hack Falls in line

308
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,519
with the same philosophy as the last one

309
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,500
you know this whole philosophy of

310
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,660
consistency so the fourth productivity

311
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,279
hack is to meal prep at the beginning of

312
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,959
the week and what you want to do is you

313
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,940
want to have the same meals for the

314
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,980
entire week now I'm in the fortunate

315
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,540
position where I have a full-time Chef

316
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,860
in pretty much every single one of my

317
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,360
homes you know obviously if I'm

318
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,740
traveling sometimes and I'm staying in a

319
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,600
hotel in a different country it's

320
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,620
different story but apart from that I

321
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,180
have that luxury and that was something

322
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,980
that I was always really looking forward

323
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,660
to once I started making serious money

324
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,640
but well before that when I was first

325
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,320
starting out my businesses at the

326
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,800
beginning of the week I would meal prep

327
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,019
the same breakfast lunch and dinner for

328
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,880
the entire week in fact actually back

329
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:01,200
then I didn't even eat breakfast I was

330
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,880
doing intermittent fasting for a few

331
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,740
years now what I would do to keep it a

332
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,200
little bit more interesting is each week

333
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,000
I might cycle a different thing so like

334
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,680
each week the breakfast or the lunch or

335
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,540
the dinner would be different so I would

336
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,060
cycle that week to week but day to day

337
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,500
within that week it was all the same now

338
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:20,040
I generally think way too many people

339
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,260
look at food as Leisure or some fun

340
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,620
thing but listen to me unless you're on

341
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,519
holiday you're retired or you are rich

342
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,760
as

343
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,800
food is fuel that is it food is

344
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,899
literally just there to fuel you nothing

345
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,160
else nothing more and from day to day

346
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,959
for me when I eat food because I still

347
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,300
don't really eat exciting food I pretty

348
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,339
much just lots of meat fish healthy fats

349
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,980
lots of avocado day to day when I'm

350
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:45,300
eating that all I see is fuel now when I

351
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,680
go to restaurants it's a totally

352
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,240
different story then you can eat for

353
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,800
enjoyment when you're on holiday once

354
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,839
again totally different story but day to

355
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,820
day all it is is fuel and maybe this is

356
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,140
kind of my Russian side coming out you

357
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,880
know I'm from a place in Russia called

358
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,920
Dagestan and I grew up there for the

359
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,720
early part of my life and I guess in

360
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,640
Russia and that you sound like food is

361
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,899
just fuel like we don't we're not very

362
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,940
romantic about food I don't know if

363
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:07,260
you've ever had Russian food maybe some

364
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,420
Russian people would disagree but it's

365
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,399
not very tasty it's just it's just

366
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,380
practical that's all it is so just make

367
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,899
sure food does not take up a crazy

368
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,980
amount of your life meal prep at the

369
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,380
beginning of the week and just make sure

370
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,060
it's the same food for the entire week

371
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,620
and then the next week you can cycle to

372
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,420
something different now the fifth

373
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,220
productivity hack is another one where

374
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,980
I'm shooting myself in the foot and that

375
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:32,160
is I want you to delete Tech talk right

376
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:34,200
now unless it has a direct correlation

377
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,940
to your line of work listen if you're a

378
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,740
short form editor let's say you know

379
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,120
you're an affiliate marketer for a

380
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,860
certain product and the way you do that

381
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,540
is through short form content on Tick

382
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,860
Tock or let's say you get leads through

383
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,839
your business through Tick Tock which

384
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,540
very few people do so let's say you are

385
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,100
the one in 50 people that actually makes

386
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,200
money through Tick Tock then of course

387
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,300
don't delete it but if you're anyone

388
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,639
else you know 49 of those 50 other

389
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,680
people just delete it there's no point

390
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,480
for it whatsoever this is just another

391
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,360
thing that is here to Rob your attention

392
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,279
and that's it that's really it and

393
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,660
listen you may even be following me on

394
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,480
Tick Tock and the funny thing is I think

395
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,760
I got to 1.5 or 2 million followers on

396
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,980
Tick Tock without ever having downloaded

397
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,720
the app in my entire life my team just

398
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,220
posts a bunch of stuff if right now if

399
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,839
you wanted me to create a tick tock I

400
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,220
wouldn't even know how to do it like I

401
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
only downloaded it three or four months

402
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,579
ago because I'm like okay this is crazy

403
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,040
we're getting like 200 million views a

404
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:28,980
month on short form between Tick Tock

405
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,839
and uh insta reels and what's the other

406
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,220
YouTube shorts so I was like you know

407
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:33,839
maybe I should download it at least

408
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,279
every once while check in and kind of

409
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,839
understand the platform and what people

410
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,060
are posting but once again that is

411
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,680
related to work so listen I am deeply

412
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,620
honored if you follow me on Tick Tock

413
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,420
but like just don't the small benefit

414
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,040
that you get from short form Clips on

415
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,720
Tick Tock because as I said That's

416
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,060
Entertainment more than anything I mean

417
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,920
the wisdom is great but the issue is the

418
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,480
little upside that you get isn't worth

419
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,160
the complete downside because you know

420
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,600
maybe you see one of my tech talks and

421
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,060
it's great and you get a new perspective

422
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,700
but that's one Tick Tock out of maybe 10

423
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,500
BS ones and 10 BS Tech talks that take

424
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,540
you into a mental spiral that you don't

425
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,040
want to be in nor should you be in so

426
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,500
that's number one the other thing is I

427
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,300
want you to mute everyone on Instagram

428
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,339
now I understand for a lot of people

429
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,680
Instagram is sort of like their social

430
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,120
CV whether that be dating whether that

431
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,860
be career listen I'm not gonna lie

432
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,180
Instagram is important in today's day

433
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,620
and age but that doesn't mean you need

434
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,320
to watch everyone's stories or everyone

435
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:28,019
posts like I pretty much have I would

436
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,339
say 90 percent of people muted on

437
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,200
Instagram because to be honest I just

438
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:33,540
don't give a sh like unless it's like a

439
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,459
close friend of mine or like c-suite

440
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,320
level of one of my companies like really

441
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:39,720
top managerial people in my companies

442
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,100
the CEOs or CMOS or whatever like I just

443
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,199
I don't need to know what you're doing

444
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,959
day to day I'm gonna be honest and you

445
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,779
need to have that exact same focus and

446
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:51,240
that exact same protection around your

447
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:53,760
attention now the next productivity hack

448
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,800
is to create a simple three-step morning

449
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,139
routine listen most morning routines are

450
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,100
absolute BS and by the way I was one of

451
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,420
those people who used to have that

452
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,160
10-step routine that would take four

453
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,139
hours so by the way when I say all of

454
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,060
the stuff I'm not judging because I've

455
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,920
been there like I told you I'm coming up

456
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,500
to my 10th year as an entrepreneur when

457
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,779
I first made my first penny online I

458
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,399
have done everything I've tried

459
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,320
everything so I'm not sitting here

460
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,540
judging you I'm just trying to relay

461
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,120
really what actually works and what's

462
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,100
fluff so when you see all these 15-step

463
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,240
morning routine blah blah and by the way

464
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,160
when you see all these morning routines

465
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,779
where they wake up at 5am it's all Bs

466
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,760
wait wake up whatever time you want to

467
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:31,199
wake up it doesn't matter trust me now

468
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,579
here's the thing if you have work or you

469
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,079
have school then yeah you should be an

470
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:35,760
early riser I'm sure most of you guys

471
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,500
know I dropped out at 17 because I was

472
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,360
already making crazy money I had an

473
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,220
employee like I had a proper business so

474
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,779
I dropped out of school at 17. I also

475
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,100
had to take care of me and my single mom

476
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,660
so you know my life story was a little

477
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,920
different but before that when I was

478
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,839
still in school I used to be an early

479
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,760
riser I hated it I'm not really a

480
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,380
morning person I hate it but for me it

481
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,839
was getting those early hours of working

482
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:57,060
before school and those early hours of

483
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,620
exercise a lot of times before school it

484
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,540
really helped me make sure that I got

485
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,339
important things done so if you fall

486
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,740
under that category then yeah of course

487
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:06,060
maybe waking up earlier makes a lot of

488
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,399
sense to make sure you get everything

489
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,019
done always but listen if you're not in

490
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,940
that category wake up whatever time you

491
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,860
want I've used to wake up at 5am I used

492
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,260
to wake up at 6am I used to wake up at 7

493
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,180
30 am now I wake up at 8 30 because I

494
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:20,100
also spend majority of my year in Dubai

495
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:23,040
and most of my employees and most of my

496
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,480
team are in America and Europe so for me

497
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,699
it doesn't make sense to wake up at 5 30

498
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,800
knowing that I have calls most days up

499
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:31,139
until 9 pm most of my leadership calls

500
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,120
start at 5 30 and end at 9 between the

501
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:34,920
different companies so find a simple

502
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,899
three-step routine you know my old

503
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,180
routine in London let's say for example

504
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,860
three years ago I would wake up at 6 30

505
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,720
I would do a little bit of journaling

506
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,339
while drinking a coffee and then my

507
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,680
personal trainer would show up at my

508
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:48,720
doorstep we'd walk two minutes to the

509
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,040
gym and I would start my training

510
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,540
session for the day that was my

511
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,279
three-step morning routine now my

512
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,899
morning routine is a little different I

513
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,759
wake up and the first thing I do is I go

514
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:59,040
jump in the cold plunge so I go down to

515
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:00,839
my home gym garage I jump in the cold

516
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,459
plunge after that I have a shower and

517
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:04,319
get ready and the third thing is I make

518
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:06,299
myself a coffee and I sit down at this

519
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,059
desk and I just have 30 minutes of me

520
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:10,919
time I just jot down ideas vision for my

521
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,720
companies I look up my overall corporate

522
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,280
structure my investments where my

523
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,660
investments fall into within my

524
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,980
different entities within my different

525
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,199
holding companies and my different

526
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,120
trusts and as I said it's a lot to

527
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,799
manage these days and then

528
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,299
I get started with the day so whatever

529
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,520
fits best in your life now I'm very

530
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:28,199
lucky where I train at 4 P.M every day I

531
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,120
like that that works for me but back in

532
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,100
the day really the only practical time

533
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,600
to work out was first thing in the

534
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,220
morning so just find whatever works for

535
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,919
you but just make sure it's a three-step

536
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,720
morning routine no 10-step or 12 step

537
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,100
and nothing that takes four hours it

538
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,780
really generally should take you no more

539
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,160
than an hour hour and a half from the

540
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,360
moment that you wake up to the moment

541
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,880
that you get to your desk and you're

542
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,500
getting to work now last hack may seem

543
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,240
simple but once again that is the beauty

544
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,760
of it and that is that I want you to lay

545
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,840
out your clothes the night before the

546
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,760
worst thing in the morning that you can

547
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,260
have is the decision fatigue of deciding

548
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,940
okay what am I going to wear today now

549
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,039
I've already told you you should have

550
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,840
your sort of homework uniform which is

551
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,460
just very simple very easy to put

552
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,559
together but still nonetheless you

553
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,000
should lay it out the night before and

554
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,980
you especially want to lay out your

555
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,360
clothes if you're working out in the

556
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,280
morning now for me I'm gonna be honest

557
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,320
it's more difficult not training than it

558
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,520
is like I love training whatever it is

559
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,020
whether that's running whether that's

560
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,640
boxing whether that's functional

561
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,500
CrossFit training whatever it is like I

562
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,000
just enjoy it but nonetheless you want

563
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,200
to lay out your clothes especially if

564
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,360
that's something that you struggle with

565
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,160
in your life or especially if you

566
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,600
struggle to wake up in the morning trust

567
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,700
me it takes two minutes a night but it

568
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,620
makes the morning so much more seamless

569
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,260
so ladies and gentlemen I say all of

570
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:39,120
this with love because as I said I have

571
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,280
tried so much stuff and especially in my

572
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,140
early days I saw so many things that I

573
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,820
thought were important to success and

574
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,440
they just weren't so this is just me

575
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,720
being honest of what has worked for me

576
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,059
over the last 10 years and what hasn't I

577
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,000
hope it was useful to you and as always

578
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:56,240
I'm watching from afar and I'm rooting

579
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,240
for you
