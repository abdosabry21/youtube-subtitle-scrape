1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,000
here's how you get ahead of 99% of

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,600
people in the next 6 to 12 months times

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,240
are changing and we are about to

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,719
experience one of the greatest wealth

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,519
transfers in history and if you want to

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,719
be on the receiving end of it there's

7
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:18,640
one thing that you must do implement the

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,000
five lost principles of The Outsiders in

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,199
order to become an outsider yourself and

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,680
unlock a life of freedom and today I'm

11
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,800
going to show you how I rescued these

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,160
principles myself and implemented them

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,520
in my own personal life which ultimately

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,600
led me to the success I have today and

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,640
how you too can rescue them in your own

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,640
life this is the

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,640
rescue let me ask you a question do you

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,360
have the false belief that money equals

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,719
Freedom you see the first step I ever

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,239
took in my journey was to establish what

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,840
truth would guide my way because

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,480
ultimately the truth that you choose to

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,640
subscribe to will determine your path

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,320
and from very early on I I was able to

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,680
see through the lies and the

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,479
manipulation of the conditioning Factory

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,920
and really see the education system for

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,640
what it actually is a factory that's

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,119
only purpose is to turn you into a

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,320
product of the system and I simply tried

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,240
to evaluate from a rational standpoint

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,720
what was the outcome of the people who

33
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,799
went through the system which was they'd

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,400
go to college then they'd study slave

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,600
like hours for 4 to six years only then

36
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,040
to graduate and continue to work slave

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,479
like hours somewhere else usually in a

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,759
job they hate that doesn't pay well and

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,840
even in the rare cases that it does they

40
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,040
have no time or location Freedom

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,119
whatsoever to enjoy the money they make

42
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,759
and back then I didn't know much but I

43
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,960
knew one thing that's not the life I

44
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,840
wanted for myself and I vividly remember

45
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,880
the day I decided that that was not

46
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,280
going to be my truth I must have been 14

47
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,320
at the time and I was taking the tube in

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,600
rush hour in London it was one of those

49
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,479
classic rainy London days but that still

50
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,159
felt so humid and sticky and everything

51
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,080
just looked gray the tube was packed

52
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:10,759
with people coming from work those days

53
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,000
where you can smell the sweat mixed with

54
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,959
that terrible smell of wet dog that

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,760
people have from walking in the rain and

56
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,360
listen that was one thing but worse was

57
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,879
that I'd look in the faces of every

58
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,160
single person coming in and out of the

59
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:25,360
tube and I remember I could just see the

60
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,040
pain and the frustration in their faces

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,120
how you could clearly notice that none

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,239
of them wanted to be there but they

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,480
simply had had no choice but to be there

64
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,360
because that's the only truth that they

65
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,120
knew that was the truth that they had

66
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,120
been conditioned to believe and I just

67
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,959
remember how depressing it felt to be

68
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,879
there amongst those people and

69
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:47,159
ultimately how when I grew up I never

70
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,480
wanted to be like that and it was on

71
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:52,080
that day when I was 13 years old on the

72
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,599
tube that I made the decision that was

73
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,000
not going to be my personal truth and

74
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,080
for the longest time I actually used to

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
have a photo of the London Underground

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,760
the London Tube as the background of my

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,480
trailer board where I had my daily to-do

78
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,000
tasks and to me that was really just a

79
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,239
reminder that that wasn't the truth that

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,920
I had chosen for myself and back then I

81
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,400
decided that it didn't matter how long

82
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,400
it would take or how much it would cost

83
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,200
I would find a way to live life on my

84
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,400
own terms a life where I would be able

85
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,400
to make Fu money and to me Fu money

86
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,159
means more money than you realistically

87
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,280
know what to do with and without having

88
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,840
to sell my soul to the system or slave

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,120
away in a corporate job until I was 60 I

90
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,200
mean after all I knew it was possible

91
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,400
because I saw other people doing it it

92
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,920
it's funny I remember I always used to

93
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,640
show my mom episodes from Ryan sir hence

94
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,560
million dooll listing and I always used

95
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,080
to tell my mom look you know I can do

96
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,799
this it's possible to make millions

97
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,840
without going to school and if I saw

98
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,200
other people do it in my mind I could do

99
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,360
it too there was nothing that they did

100
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,400
that I couldn't do myself listen they

101
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,360
weren't building Rockets they weren't

102
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,120
programming a machine Learning System

103
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,959
they were selling houses and I knew I

104
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,519
could do that too and obviously you guys

105
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,239
know the story I didn't end up going the

106
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,959
real estate path that's not how I made

107
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,640
my money but what matters is that I knew

108
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,519
that there was an ocean of opportunities

109
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,840
out there that could provide me with

110
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,439
financial location and time freedom and

111
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,120
without me having to slave away at a

112
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,879
corporate job for decades to achieve it

113
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,519
and that was my truth and the craziest

114
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,840
part of this entire story is that 10

115
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,560
years later a decade later Ryan Siran

116
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,799
ended up reaching out to me because he

117
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,440
wanted to feature me in his new book and

118
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,800
then we also ended up meeting up and

119
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,479
collaborating on a YouTube video

120
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,120
together so I ended up just being one of

121
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:29,000
those crazy full circle moments you know

122
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,919
from watching this guy at 13 and being

123
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,160
like I can do something and obviously I

124
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:34,080
didn't end up going the route that he

125
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,560
went but I made so much of myself that

126
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,960
someone that I used to look up to ended

127
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,880
up wanting to feature me inside of his

128
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,440
book so the world really does work in

129
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,400
crazy ways now it's very important for

130
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,320
me to be nuanced here because as I've

131
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,120
mentioned multiple times already the

132
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,080
truth is a very subjective and personal

133
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,720
concept at the end of the day it changes

134
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,240
from person to person and what's the

135
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,800
truth for me might not be the truth for

136
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,560
you for example if you truly want to

137
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,520
become an engineer a doctor a lawyer and

138
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,880
and that's what you want to do because

139
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,600
you've clearly experienced what it's

140
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,120
like to be an engineer a doctor or a

141
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,280
lawyer not because you've been

142
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,400
conditioned to want these professions

143
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,880
because their Prestige or because the

144
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,680
conditioning Factory brainwashed you

145
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,080
into thinking you'd make a lot of money

146
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,440
and become free through these

147
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,319
professions if you truly want to follow

148
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,720
one of these paths because that's what

149
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,360
you're truly passionate about so be it

150
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,440
then that is your truth and no one can

151
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,880
tell you otherwise and obviously I can't

152
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,160
help you in those cases because that's

153
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,919
not where my exp ertes and that's

154
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,759
totally fine there's still a lot of

155
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,600
people out there who can help you follow

156
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:39,919
those paths now what is important to

157
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,759
attain yourself is why you chose that as

158
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,639
your truth if the reason you want to

159
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,840
pursue those careers is so that you can

160
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,800
achieve the outcomes that the system has

161
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,000
sold you on them that the reason as to

162
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,680
why you want to become a doctor a lawyer

163
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,800
an engineer is because those are the

164
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,520
safest and most Surefire ways to get

165
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,960
financial location and time Freedom you

166
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,440
might really want to question where do

167
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,360
those beliefs come from are they

168
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,600
actually based on cold hard facts or are

169
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,680
they simply based on what the

170
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,800
conditioning Factory has told you are

171
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,639
those beliefs making you free or are

172
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,280
they making you a product of the system

173
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,960
again you need to truly stop and reflect

174
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,240
on what truth actually means for you

175
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,840
because the truth you choose to

176
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,720
subscribe to will determine your path

177
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,880
and your path will determine your

178
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,919
results maybe going to college is your

179
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:32,280
truth maybe it's not it all depends on

180
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:32,280
your answer answer to the

181
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,000
question this is how I unwired my

182
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,120
limiting beliefs growing up we're fed

183
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,720
with dozens of limiting beliefs that if

184
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,400
not taken care will affect us profoundly

185
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,720
through our entire lives at this point

186
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,919
you already know that but there's

187
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,840
usually a problem getting rid of them is

188
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,639
a hard thing to do and the reason why

189
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,319
it's such a hard thing to do is when

190
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,400
you're first starting out you have no

191
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:01,240
references to base yourself on you don't

192
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,240
don't know how successful people operate

193
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,879
because respectfully you probably have

194
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,919
never spent time with successful people

195
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,919
in the first place growing up majority

196
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:11,240
of us spend our time with our parents

197
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:13,400
our teachers our friends who usually

198
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,520
come from a family with very similar

199
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,960
economic backgrounds to our own so what

200
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,479
ends up happening is that these people

201
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,720
just reinforce those already existing

202
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:22,800
limiting beliefs that's inside of us you

203
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,800
know I'll even tell you a little story

204
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,840
about this my first tattoo here it says

205
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,160
my cup runneth over it's written in the

206
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,360
Old Testament and I actually got this

207
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,039
tattoo when I was 16 years old you know

208
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,840
I was definitely a very naughty teenager

209
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,599
and obviously with all areas of my life

210
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,199
I grew up very quickly so I definitely

211
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,599
don't recommend you go getting a tattoo

212
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,080
at 16 but the reason I got this my cup

213
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:43,879
runneth over it basically means that I

214
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,400
have more than I need I'm overflowing

215
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,639
I'm abundant and the reason I got this

216
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,520
tattoo and the reason it was very

217
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,440
important to me as a constant reminder

218
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,800
to myself was growing up my mom always

219
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,879
used to tell me take as much as you can

220
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,240
because you never know when you're going

221
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,440
to get anymore and that was her truth

222
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,879
and I told totally empathize with that

223
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,720
truth because listen when you are the

224
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:07,960
youngest of seven children growing up in

225
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,199
the Soviet Union that statement is true

226
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,800
you really don't know when you're going

227
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,120
to get anymore so if something's in

228
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,840
front of you take as much as you can and

229
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,800
this what I'm saying beliefs can get

230
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,879
passed down to your parents even if they

231
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,280
don't serve you so between that and also

232
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,080
a lot of the financial struggles that we

233
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,000
had growing up you know me and her my

234
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,479
mom almost used to tell me take as much

235
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,800
as you can because you don't know where

236
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:28,039
you're going to get anymore and that

237
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,800
just didn't serve me that was my

238
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:31,400
attitude growing up even though I still

239
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,479
a young kid I would always think like

240
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,919
how can I get the better end of this

241
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,279
deal or if there's a certain amount of

242
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,360
something how can I get the most of it

243
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,399
or even just down to small things I

244
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,959
would always overeat even if I was full

245
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,880
I would force myself to eat more because

246
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,560
my mom's voice was always in my head

247
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,800
that belief system was always in my head

248
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,160
and one of the things I will give myself

249
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,320
credit for was working through that

250
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,959
limiting belief system you know I ended

251
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,360
up getting the tattoo and said I'm not

252
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:52,959
saying you should get a tattoo but the

253
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,160
rest of my life ever since I was 16

254
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,640
years old I have been so abundant even

255
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,839
when I had nothing I I acted so

256
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,440
abundantly I gave so much I was so

257
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,959
generous with the people around me if

258
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,200
they deserved it obviously and weren't

259
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,680
just there for the ride and it just

260
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,120
broke this belief so this is stuff that

261
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,680
I've had to work through over the years

262
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,720
many things in my life that's just one

263
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,399
example now getting back to you again

264
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,240
you really can't address or get rid of

265
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,120
those beliefs if these are the only

266
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,200
beliefs that you know you know the way I

267
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,200
like to explain it is this the amount of

268
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,000
colors that our eyes can see is actually

269
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,000
very small compared to the amount of

270
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,800
colors that's out there in the entire

271
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,160
light spectrum for example there are a

272
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,079
few birds that can actually see

273
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,680
ultraviolet light which obviously we

274
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:34,959
can't see and that means that they can

275
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,800
see millions of colors that we don't

276
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,680
even imagine exist you know if they were

277
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,040
to look at the most colorful TV screens

278
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,519
that exist today you know they'd

279
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,959
probably think to themselves what

280
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,560
horribly unrealistic colors but from our

281
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:48,160
perspective the 6K or 8K TV it looks

282
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,160
extremely photorealistic and that's

283
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,079
because we judge things for what we can

284
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,200
see and the same happens with our

285
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:56,360
beliefs and our experiences we all

286
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,360
experience the world based on our own

287
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,959
limiting realities that are based on the

288
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,440
things that we know know and we see

289
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,760
however that's not the full reality

290
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,480
because there are a lot of things that

291
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,279
you don't know or you don't get to see

292
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,399
or you don't get to experience and

293
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,320
that's why you might have dozens of

294
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,240
limiting beliefs that you're not even

295
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,839
aware of because you're not even aware

296
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,120
that different realities exist and

297
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,800
unfortunately the average person has no

298
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,760
idea on how different rich people think

299
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,399
and approach things compared to broke

300
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,959
people let me give you a very concrete

301
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,959
example most people operate from a place

302
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:34,720
of scarcity especially when it comes to

303
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:37,120
money which also makes them very

304
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,200
emotional towards money they're always

305
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,760
afraid that they won't have enough or

306
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,760
that the process of making money is

307
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,560
always hard miserable and stressful

308
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,639
because that's what they've always

309
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,639
experienced or the classic example of

310
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,320
someone who operates from that mindset

311
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:53,519
and just started a business and is

312
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,079
afraid to charge higher prices because

313
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,600
he thinks that everyone else has the

314
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,120
same view on money that they have and

315
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,360
that if something costs more than $200

316
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,279
no one's going to buy it because it's

317
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,760
too expensive all while the same time

318
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,200
there's competitors selling the same

319
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,519
product or service for two times five

320
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,880
times 10 times the price and this really

321
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:15,920
all comes back to their limited

322
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,760
reference towards money listen I can

323
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,800
tell you from firsthand experience you'd

324
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,680
be surprised how indifferent rich people

325
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,600
are towards money and by the way that's

326
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,160
usually why they make so much money in

327
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,880
the first place because they're not

328
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,760
emotional about it they're not afraid of

329
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,880
charging more they're not afraid of

330
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,720
investing heavy amounts of money knowing

331
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,279
very well that they could lose it all

332
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,519
now the point I want to get to here is

333
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,279
this the only way to truly get rid of

334
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,800
your limiting beliefs is by having more

335
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,240
references and that is observing how

336
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,959
successful people specifically think

337
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,480
approach and act on things and what type

338
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,639
of beliefs they hold compared to what

339
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,519
you currently hold and the only way to

340
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,519
do that is by spending time with

341
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,360
successful people now obviously the

342
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,279
problem is where do you find those

343
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,279
people and how do you get them to spend

344
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:03,320
time with you in the first place well

345
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,800
that's the question I asked myself when

346
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,519
I was 13 you see back then I didn't know

347
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,480
any successful people that I could spend

348
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,079
time with to learn from it and

349
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,040
understand how they think and what

350
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:18,160
beliefs they hold so I found a solution

351
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:21,120
to that books back when I was 13 14 15 I

352
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,680
would spend entire afternoons at Brixton

353
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,680
book mongers in London reading

354
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,279
secondhand books they had there and I

355
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,079
used to literally just read the books

356
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,839
there because I couldn't afford to buy

357
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,120
more than two or three books a month so

358
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,839
I used to go there and just try to read

359
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,399
as many books in an afternoon as

360
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:35,839
possible you know I was reading so much

361
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,000
that if you really thought about it

362
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,360
majority of my time was spent with

363
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
extremely successful individuals not

364
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,160
physically but in the world of ideas

365
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,560
which according to Plato as we mentioned

366
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,440
in episode 2 is technically the real

367
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,760
world anyways Jokes Aside by doing that

368
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,360
I really started to share the same

369
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,839
beliefs and World Views that these

370
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,279
successful people had and by doing so it

371
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,959
really started to unwire all of the

372
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,079
limiting beliefs towards money and

373
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,440
success that the conditioning Factory

374
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:05,360
had deeply injected into my brain I was

375
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,240
essentially hacking my way into spending

376
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,680
time with successful people who were

377
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,920
completely inaccessible to me back then

378
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,399
now that doesn't mean that you need to

379
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,120
read hundreds of books like I did

380
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,120
Growing Up but you do need to learn from

381
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,760
people who are more successful than you

382
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,519
which led us directly to our next

383
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,519
principle of the

384
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,240
outsider just like with all things they

385
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,880
come with positive and negative sides

386
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,120
and reading books is also one of them

387
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,959
here's the thing books are a great

388
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,600
source of knowledge especially when it

389
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:39,360
comes to the belief side of things but

390
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,160
this is only one part of the equation

391
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,120
the other part is that you need to know

392
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,320
how to take the knowledge you have and

393
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,320
break it down into an actionable plan

394
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,680
that you can Implement in real life and

395
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,320
the problem with books is that they're

396
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,440
written in a way so that they're

397
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,079
relevant to a mass audience which means

398
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,600
that the author needs to give advice

399
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,240
that's going to be relevant to people

400
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,680
from very different ages very different

401
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,279
backgrounds and most importantly

402
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,279
in very different fields of work and

403
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:07,240
career stages which in turn means that

404
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,160
their advice has to be somewhat Broad

405
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,519
and non-specific and that's really the

406
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,639
big problem with books their advice is

407
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,759
not tailored to your specific situation

408
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,600
which means that even if you do read

409
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,199
hundreds of books like I did you'll

410
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,920
still have to figure out a bunch of

411
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,880
things by yourself and that's usually

412
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,639
when people fail because the devil is in

413
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,839
the details and that's why having a

414
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:29,639
mentor is of such importance they can

415
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,240
really analyze your situation from their

416
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,199
perspective and since they're so much

417
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,600
more resourceful than you are they can

418
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,440
pinpoint exactly what you need to do or

419
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,279
what you're doing wrong and it's usually

420
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,360
something that if you were to try to do

421
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,240
yourself it would take you months of

422
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,959
failing and bumping your head against

423
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,040
the wall in order for you to figure out

424
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,199
how to do it on your own sometimes even

425
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,120
years and that's why it took me so long

426
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:53,880
to achieve success and most people get

427
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,079
very confused when I say that because

428
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,839
they see me achieving a lot of success

429
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,279
at a young age so they just assume that

430
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,519
I got here quickly but the reality is I

431
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,560
just got so successful so young because

432
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,720
I started so early on not because I

433
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,480
succeeded fast per se as I said back

434
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,519
when I was 13 I was already reading

435
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,199
dozens of books trying to figure out how

436
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:14,279
to be successful something that most

437
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:16,480
people only start doing in their mid-20s

438
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:19,199
so the reason I'm 10 years ahead is just

439
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,279
because I started 10 years earlier now I

440
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,360
could have achieved success way quicker

441
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,800
if I had mentors from the Geto because

442
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,360
if you really evaluate my progress it

443
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,199
took me around 5 years to achieve what

444
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,639
most most people who follow the right

445
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:36,000
advice tend to achieve in one or two and

446
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:38,120
I knew that and I also knew that a

447
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,519
mentor could help me FasTrack my way to

448
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,920
success but there was just one big

449
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,639
problem I couldn't afford a mentor and

450
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,759
this is really the Paradox of having a

451
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,720
mentor a person is only a qualified

452
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:51,079
Mentor if they have achieved success

453
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,120
themselves which means they probably

454
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:54,880
already make a lot of money so an hour

455
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,319
of their time is going to be pretty damn

456
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,720
expensive and that's the Paradox here

457
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:00,839
having mentors is one of the most

458
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,880
Surefire ways to success but having

459
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,040
mentors is expensive and you can only

460
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,120
really afford them once you're

461
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,639
successful already so how do you do it

462
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,360
if you're a beginner who can't afford to

463
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:11,240
drop tens of thousands of dollars a

464
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,120
month on mentorship but you still want

465
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,000
to have a mentor and that was the

466
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,120
problem that I personally faced and

467
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,560
that's why I resorted to using books as

468
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,440
my mentors so if you're in a position

469
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,120
where you don't have a single penny in

470
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,240
your bank account you have no job or no

471
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,079
income coming in you have no access to

472
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,920
money whatsoever if that is the case

473
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:33,560
then I'd recommend you start doing the

474
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,560
same thing that I did use books as your

475
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,240
guide but let's not sit here and

476
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,279
 ourselves and say that you're

477
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,079
mentored by Elon Musk because you've

478
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,680
watched a YouTube video of him or you

479
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:45,920
read his biography because you're not

480
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,240
it's simple if you cannot ask him

481
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,920
questions he's not your mentor and you

482
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,240
are going to be missing out on the most

483
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,279
important aspect of having a mentor

484
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,360
which is the tailored advice to your

485
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:59,360
specific situation coming from someone

486
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,279
who's way more resourceful than you are

487
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,079
now I found another way of getting

488
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,880
mentors at a huge discount without ever

489
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,760
having to drop tens of thousands of

490
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,720
dollars a month to get only a few

491
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,799
minutes of their time and I'll go ahead

492
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,799
and explain exactly how in just a

493
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,240
second now seeking intense hardship is

494
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,880
one of the most important principles of

495
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,439
them all you can go ahead and write this

496
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,079
down you are not going to be successful

497
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:28,640
if you don't become a master of

498
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,320
self-discipline and self-control if it's

499
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,360
very simple in order to be successful

500
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:37,640
you need to execute on stuff day in and

501
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,640
day out consistently and that requires

502
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,600
very high levels of discipline it's easy

503
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,520
to do something for 2 weeks in a row now

504
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,200
think about what positive action have

505
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,919
you executed on every single day day in

506
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,799
and day out without fail for 90 days in

507
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:53,520
a row most people nothing except for

508
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:55,000
scrolling on Tik talk and maybe that's

509
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,280
why you haven't achieved the levels of

510
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,760
success you want to get to and you might

511
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,880
have heard me talking about some called

512
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,120
monk mode that was my way to hack

513
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,960
discipline and self-control in my

514
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,720
day-to-day life you see nowadays on

515
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,520
average we live very comfortable lives

516
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,919
even compared to what the wealthiest

517
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,480
humans on Earth would live like even

518
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,760
just a few hundred years ago we don't

519
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,120
have to suffer with a lack of food we

520
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,000
don't have to endure extreme

521
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,840
temperatures because when it's cold we

522
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,520
have Heating and when it's hot we just

523
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,280
turn on the air conditioning and that

524
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,280
has put us in a very unique situation

525
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,320
that as humans we're not used to and

526
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,080
it's made us too comfortable it's made

527
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,000
us weak and and tapping into that inner

528
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,159
discipline and living a life of

529
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,440
self-control is one of the biggest

530
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:39,039
advantages you can have in a world of

531
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,360
distractions and instant gratification

532
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,960
and that's why I created my mck mode

533
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,799
protocol and the discipline and

534
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,600
self-control that comes with it has made

535
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:47,919
me be able to achieve two times five

536
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,679
times 10 times more than I ever would

537
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,039
have been able to if I was just another

538
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,679
Instagram gratification driven human

539
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:57,799
being most people have no idea just how

540
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,799
much they can achieve in 90 days of

541
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:02,919
focus discipline execution day in and

542
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,960
day out because that's exactly what the

543
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:06,080
conditioning Factory wants for you they

544
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,679
don't want you to know your true

545
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,520
potential they want you addicted to

546
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:12,919
their dopamine peaking social networks

547
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,919
so that way you can't help to live

548
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:17,640
without it and that's exactly what the

549
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:20,440
monk mode protocol seeks to fix and that

550
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,120
is how you reset your brain for Success

551
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,559
the way it works is very simple you

552
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,640
select a period to stick to for your

553
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,799
monk mode protocol anywhere from 21 to

554
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,400
90 days

555
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,480
then we have three non-negotiable tasks

556
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,039
that you have to do every single day

557
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,159
missed the day you failed and you start

558
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:40,400
all over from zero and the three

559
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:42,159
non-negotiables are 30 minutes of

560
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,880
exercise whatever exercise you want to

561
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:47,720
do 10 minutes of meditation and no

562
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,200
alcohol or then you can add anywhere

563
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,080
from one to three custom variables to

564
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,000
tailor your monk mode routine

565
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,960
specifically to your situation that

566
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,880
could be reading 10 pages a day working

567
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,840
on your business for 4 hours a day

568
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,200
having less than 2 hours of screen time

569
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,720
on your mobile phone whatever you feel

570
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,280
like is going to push the needle forward

571
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,919
for you and just by doing that for 21 to

572
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,360
90 days you'll become a more disciplined

573
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,520
individual than 95% of the world's

574
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,240
population and the results will speak

575
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,640
for themselves I mean listen I know that

576
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,039
they did for me and if you combine this

577
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,520
with one specific thing that I'm going

578
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:24,480
to show you in just a second the results

579
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,520
you can achieve in 90 days will be

580
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,159
greater than what most regular people

581
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,159
can achieve in years

582
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,600
now here's what most people get wrong

583
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,480
about achieving Freedom the truth is you

584
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,320
don't need to become a millionaire to

585
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,559
become a free person you can achieve

586
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,000
Freedom making as little as $5,000 a

587
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:46,200
month $10,000 a month because income is

588
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
all relative for example a lot of people

589
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,559
look up to professions like doctors

590
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,039
because in most countries they make a

591
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:53,919
lot of money you know it's a very

592
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:56,039
achievable way to make $40,000 $80,000

593
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,360
maybe even $100,000 a month as an

594
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:04,640
example but that comes out at a cost

595
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:06,200
time location and often your sanity why

596
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,799
because usually doctors have to work

597
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,440
double or triple shifts just to make

598
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,000
those amounts and at first when you're

599
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,159
young that's fine you know you have a

600
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,880
lot of energy and you can endure it the

601
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,919
problem is it's not sustainable and even

602
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,799
worse most doctors when they start

603
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:22,960
making that type of money they start

604
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,679
living a lifestyle that requires that

605
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,200
amount of money to sustain it meaning

606
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,360
they become a slave of their own life

607
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,159
style and that's exactly what the

608
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,960
conditioning Factory wants for you

609
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,880
because no man is more enslaved than the

610
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,000
one who falsely believes in his own

611
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,919
freedom I mean just think about it are

612
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,080
you really free if you can't go

613
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,360
somewhere you want at the time you want

614
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,279
no you're not and if you can't go where

615
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,400
you want because you lack money that's

616
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,840
fine you know that that's fixable now if

617
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,520
the reason you can't go wherever you

618
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,760
want to go is because someone else

619
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,679
doesn't allow you to even if you have

620
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,600
the money to do so you're enslaved

621
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,440
you're still a product of the system I

622
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,159
mean after all who is truly free the

623
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,679
doctor who makes $100,000 a month but is

624
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:10,080
a slave to his lifestyle and can only go

625
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,400
wherever he wants for 2 weeks of a year

626
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,240
and sometimes he doesn't even get to

627
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,679
choose specifically which weeks those

628
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,480
are or the guy that makes $10,000 a

629
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,720
month but can work from anywhere they

630
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,720
want at any time of the week and chooses

631
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,600
to spend his money however he wants

632
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,400
because he's not bound to any specific

633
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,320
lifestyle listen the answer is obvious

634
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,840
understand this freedom is not about how

635
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,600
much money you have but rather how much

636
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,279
money you make without having to

637
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,279
sacrifice the financial location and

638
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,000
time aspects of your personal life to do

639
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,760
it and that's why I personally chose the

640
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,600
ladder I chose to be the guy that can

641
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,720
work from anywhere I chose to be the guy

642
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,600
that can do whatever he wants whenever

643
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,840
he wants and I chose to be the guy who

644
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,240
ends up making more money than any

645
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,159
career that the conditioning Factory

646
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,880
tells you to pursue because that's what

647
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,559
Financial Freedom truly means and in

648
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,760
order to do so I followed a very

649
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,440
specific curriculum that allowed me to

650
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,600
accomplish that and the first step in

651
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:06,279
this curriculum was to choose the right

652
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,400
industry to be in today 80% of success

653
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:10,159
is being in the right industry I mean

654
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,640
just look at everyone who's successful

655
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,520
at your age right now and in what

656
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,080
industry they're in they're not lawyers

657
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:20,320
they're not doctors they're not dentists

658
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,279
they are all Outsiders every single one

659
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:27,279
of them succeeded outside of the system

660
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,919
where the Internet it's simple today

661
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,039
succeeding in the the internet is 10

662
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,240
times easier than succeeding within the

663
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,600
system because the amount of demand for

664
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,840
people who have internet related skills

665
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,360
is huge and the amount of people who

666
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,279
possess those skills is so little I mean

667
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,919
just ask anyone that has a company that

668
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:45,720
sells through the internet what their

669
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,840
biggest problem is their answer is

670
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,520
always going to be the same finding good

671
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,600
talent the truth is there's a few very

672
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,600
specific skills that if you possess them

673
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,120
you become an extremely valued

674
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,159
professional and as long as you pick up

675
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,480
the right skills success becomes becomes

676
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,000
inevitable because the amount of

677
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,799
businesses out there seeking for people

678
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,240
with those skill sets and by the way

679
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:08,760
willing to pay top dollar for them is

680
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,120
immense inside of educate my online

681
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,640
education platform I have thousands of

682
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,039
students who for the longest time were

683
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,320
stuck being a product of the system and

684
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:20,760
went on to Achieve Financial Freedom to

685
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,919
those exact same skills and I'll reveal

686
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,760
them in a second as well as the exact

687
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,840
curriculum I've followed to make

688
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:31,240
millions and Achieve Financial location

689
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,840
and time freedom for myself so look what

690
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,840
you have to do now above all else is

691
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,240
analyze what's happening today there's

692
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,200
two big events unfolding the first is

693
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,440
the push for stage four conditioning the

694
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,600
media the school systems the big

695
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,799
industries that have final say on how

696
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,000
the school system is ran even the social

697
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,399
media networks they are all owned by the

698
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,320
same people the big universities that

699
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:55,559
have more in their endowment accounts

700
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,919
than most Fortune 500 companies have in

701
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:58,600
their bank accounts while they're

702
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:00,720
working closely with Wall Street to

703
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,880
enforce their agenda down your throats

704
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,399
both in University settings as well as

705
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,399
in the workspace the conditioning

706
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:07,880
Factory has everything streamline they

707
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:09,960
have all their pieces in the right

708
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,240
places they already control the

709
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,279
narrative they control what can and

710
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,760
can't be said they control who can say

711
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,640
what because if you're part of one of

712
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,279
their favorite groups you can do and say

713
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,240
whatever you want no matter how

714
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:25,320
segregated it is as long as you're

715
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,120
aligned with their agenda and if they

716
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,320
manage to complete their implementation

717
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,120
of State for conditioning you know what

718
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,960
happens next well the ones who decide to

719
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,520
follow their own version of Truth and

720
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,159
try to become free individuals will face

721
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,600
the exact same fate that Socrates did

722
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:45,200
they find excuses to come after

723
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,200
you you see Socrates didn't steal he

724
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,600
didn't kill anyone all he did was make

725
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,760
people aware of the truth and just how

726
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,520
ignorant and indoctrinated they were by

727
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,360
the system and what happened he got

728
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,919
executed because of that for corrupting

729
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,520
the youth use and that was not during a

730
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,240
dictatorship by the way that was

731
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,039
literally in the birthplace of democracy

732
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,840
the reigning government system in the

733
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:09,720
entire West and if you think that that

734
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,200
only happened back in the days just

735
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,320
think back to any dictatorship ever you

736
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,919
don't agree with their truth what

737
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,440
happens they come after you it's that

738
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:18,919
simple and you know that today already

739
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,480
there's a lot of things that you can't

740
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:22,440
say right now that were considered

741
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,799
trivial just a few years ago it's

742
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,760
getting harder and harder to succeed and

743
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,640
be free by the minute and if you don't

744
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:34,039
do anything about it that will become

745
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:36,799
your reality period now it's also during

746
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:39,000
these periods of monumental change that

747
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,480
the biggest opportunities arise and the

748
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,919
last time an event of this magnitude

749
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,080
happened was in ancient Greece before

750
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,039
Jesus was even born that's how long ago

751
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,799
it was and today we know the exact

752
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,840
principles that have been lost for

753
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,440
millenniums that ultimately led to the

754
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,440
creation of some of the most successful

755
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,080
men the world has ever seen you know

756
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,480
back then people who used to be mere

757
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,240
peasants went on to conquer entire

758
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,880
continents from edge to edge under their

759
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,880
mentors and became generals rulers and

760
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,600
even Kings along the way it was one of

761
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,840
the greatest social shifts in history

762
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,840
and history repeats itself and we could

763
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,080
be about to experience the same with a

764
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,880
great rescue but the time is ticking

765
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,640
I've given you the five lost principles

766
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,760
to become an outsider and when you

767
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,919
implement all five of these principles

768
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,760
you too will become an outsider and

769
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,000
you'll get to enjoy all of the spoil

770
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,640
that come with living a life of complete

771
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,720
freedom and I'm not referring

772
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,799
specifically to money here after all

773
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,240
majority of you watching didn't get

774
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:39,399
started in this journey because of the

775
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,480
money but rather because of the

776
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:43,559
experiences that being free can provide

777
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,640
you with now for some of you that might

778
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:47,120
be the ability to drop out of college

779
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,559
for some of you it might be the ability

780
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,399
to finally quit your job to stop working

781
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:53,399
on someone else's dream and start

782
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:55,320
working on your own or it might be the

783
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:57,200
ability to start working on something

784
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,799
that actually fulfills you that allows

785
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,120
you to to take care of the ones around

786
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,760
you and do whatever you want whenever

787
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,519
you want without having to get the

788
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,320
approval of someone else basically what

789
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,679
it means to become an outsider is that

790
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,159
you'll finally get to break free of all

791
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,880
of the social conditioning you've been

792
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:16,159
fed and take back ownership of your life

793
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:19,559
to live it on your own terms by your own

794
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:21,519
rules that's what an outsider does and

795
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:22,799
now you have two options you either

796
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:24,480
decide to go back to what you were doing

797
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,799
before and just pretend that you're not

798
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,399
aware that doing that will never lead

799
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,880
you to any suc success and that

800
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:33,000
everything you just learned during this

801
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,360
event it just never happened or you

802
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,559
decide to become an outsider yourself

803
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,519
and at this point you should have

804
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:41,960
already established what your truth is

805
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:43,880
so you are the only one that can tell

806
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,919
what is the right decision based on what

807
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,080
the truth is for you if you don't want

808
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,080
to become an outsider that is totally

809
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,360
fine listen that might not be the truth

810
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,640
you want to guide your path and if

811
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,720
that's the case I genuinely wish the

812
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,080
best of luck for you but I can't really

813
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,039
help you any further

814
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,960
now if you decide to become an outsider

815
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,000
you're going to need number one to

816
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,720
unwire your limiting beliefs to have a

817
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,760
mentor to have a curriculum to seek

818
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,480
intense hardship to forge discipline and

819
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,679
self-control and the truth is you're

820
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,000
probably not going to be able to do it

821
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:18,240
yourself whether you like it or not I

822
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,080
wasn't Plato wasn't Aristotle wasn't

823
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,399
Alexander the Great wasn't and I'm not

824
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,000
saying you have to necessarily learn

825
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:24,240
from me by the way you can go ahead and

826
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,720
find different people out there that

827
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,760
teach you each one of these skills

828
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,080
individually that is definitely an

829
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,519
option what is not an option is trying

830
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,200
to learn everything yourself now if you

831
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:35,720
do want to learn from me I'm going to

832
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,840
provide you with the five loss

833
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,960
principles today starting with the same

834
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,440
curriculum that I personally used to go

835
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,519
from zero to a multi-millionaire in my

836
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,440
early 20s now as I mentioned a few times

837
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:48,760
during this video I have an education

838
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,480
platform called educate now inside of

839
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,320
our platform we have taught around

840
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,679
30,000 people to this day on how to

841
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,200
start a high income Online Career from

842
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,720
zero and work your way up to to $10,000

843
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,480
a month this provides you with the

844
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,320
financial location and time Freedom

845
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,880
needed to live a life of freedom and one

846
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,399
thing is a fact there are hundreds of

847
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,840
skills you can learn in order to make

848
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:15,000
money online but some skills have a way

849
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,360
higher demand than others and of course

850
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,240
if you choose one of those your odds of

851
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,960
success Skyrocket so here are the three

852
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,519
best high income skills for beginners to

853
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,799
make $110,000 a month the first one is

854
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:29,200
agency the agency curriculum presented

855
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,919
inside of our program agency Navigator

856
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,799
now agency Navigator is the curriculum

857
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:35,279
you need in order to start a location

858
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,519
independent online business from scratch

859
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,240
and scale it to a full-time income in

860
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:42,399
the shortest time frame possible even if

861
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,360
you have no previous experience and this

862
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:47,360
is the curriculum I've used myself to

863
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:50,159
make my first $110,000 month my first

864
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,200
$100,000 and even my first million at

865
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,519
the age of 18 it simply works and I'm

866
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,039
Not only living proof of it but so are

867
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,840
our students our average student takes

868
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:01,639
around 67 days to sign their first

869
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,279
paying Clan and the average Clan

870
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:06,120
retainer of our students is $2,000 a

871
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,799
month and the real beauty is that after

872
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,480
they sign that first one they really get

873
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,240
that confidence under their belt it

874
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,360
takes them around half that time to sign

875
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,840
their second client and at this point

876
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,559
they're already making a full-time

877
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,639
income now I want you to take the

878
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,600
example from Jackson to understand the

879
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:22,679
power of this business model he signed

880
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,679
his first client for $2,000 a month 3

881
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:27,240
months ago he has now gotten paid a

882
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:29,159
total of $6,000 from this one client

883
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,279
alone and he will still continue to get

884
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:33,080
paid by this very same clan for months

885
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,720
and potentially years to come I mean

886
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,679
just think about how much this one clan

887
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,480
can generate him in its entire lifetime

888
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,559
dozens and dozens of thousands of

889
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,279
dollars all of this money because he

890
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:46,159
sold this client once and I personally

891
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:48,720
selected this model because my personal

892
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,320
strength lies in managing people and

893
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,120
with this business model all you have to

894
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,519
do is connect businesses that have a

895
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:56,320
problem with a contractor who can fix

896
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:58,200
that problem for them so I basically

897
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,240
just find the right people who get all

898
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,240
of the work done for me which by the way

899
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,159
is usually the boring part and allow me

900
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,600
to focus only on the activities that

901
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,760
grow my business and make me more money

902
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,320
now for years that's the only thing that

903
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,120
I taught students how to start an agency

904
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,279
and I've gotten literally thousands of

905
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,600
students to quit their jobs and even

906
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:20,320
created a few dozen millionaires there

907
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,120
is literally no program in the industry

908
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,760
with more success stories than the

909
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,600
agency Navigator now along the way I

910
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,320
noticed that starting a business it's

911
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,159
not the only way of succeeding you know

912
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,080
the truth is majority of six and seven

913
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,559
figure earners are not actually business

914
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,559
owners instead they work for the right

915
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,799
businesses and one of the fastest ways

916
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,639
to get to $10,000 a month online without

917
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,279
having to start a business and deal with

918
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:43,880
all of the headaches that come with it

919
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:46,200
such as product development Service

920
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,639
delivery managing employees and payroll

921
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,600
marketing Etc is to Simply become a

922
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:52,519
sales rep to a business that already

923
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,039
makes a lot of money you simply get to

924
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:56,120
sell their product which is already

925
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:58,760
proven and sells a lot and the more you

926
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,440
sell the more money you make here's the

927
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,320
thing majority of the people think they

928
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,159
need to become the new Iman gaji to

929
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,399
achieve the freedom they want and that

930
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,480
couldn't be further from the truth I

931
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,679
have hundreds of people who work for me

932
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,200
who achieve their own financial location

933
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:13,679
and time freedom and you've probably

934
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,320
seen them hanging out with me in some of

935
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,480
my videos all you need to do is become

936
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,880
someone that wealthy people like me

937
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,360
would hire and I personally employ more

938
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,440
than 50 sales reps throughout all of my

939
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,159
portfolio companies between my personal

940
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,720
software companies my e-learning

941
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:30,519
business as well as the other companies

942
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,120

943
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:35,159
crazy we have 19-year-olds making killer

Town some months they're in Italy some

947
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,600
months they're in LA and as long as they

948
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:43,039
show up and they perform I could not

949
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,679
care if they take their calls from

950
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,600
Antarctica they have their location

951
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:47,960

inside of educate is Penta profit now if

959
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:04,039
you don't want to be talking to people

960
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:06,039
all day long and instead you prefer to

961
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:07,919
just work on your computer this is the

962
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:09,520
one for you inside of Penta profit you

963
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,839
learn how to write messages that make

964
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,960
people take action that is basically

965
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:17,200
writing emails ads website Pages or any

966
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,040
other form of online medium that has

967
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,440
text on it this is one of the most in

968
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,599
demand skills today and businesses pay

969
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,440
hundreds of thousands of dollars to

970
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,440
those who have such skill set why

971
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,760
because one one single video one single

972
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,000
ad one single email can generate that

973
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,560
business millions and millions of

974
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,240
dollars because the amount of people

975
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,200
that you can reach with a video or an ad

976
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,879
today is literally in the hundreds of

977
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,839
millions and the best part about it is

978
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:43,480
that in today's day and age you don't

979
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,720
actually even have to be good at writing

980
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,440
to succeed with this curriculum now I

981
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,520
know that's quite a few options to

982
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,119
choose from and deciding what's the best

983
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,520
for you can be overwhelming but you

984
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,240
don't need to worry about it the first

985
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,079
thing we'll do once you join educate is

986
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,240
to help you choose what is the best

987
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,400
skill for you your specific personality

988
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,000
type so this way you know exactly which

989
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,040
one you should choose to have the

990
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,720
highest chances at success now one of

991
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,640
the most important principles of an

992
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,160
outsider as we covered in depth during

993
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,480
the rescue is to have a mentor and at

994
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,240
this point you already understand if you

995
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,640
want to succeed and truly become an

996
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:20,079
outsider who gets to enjoy financial

997
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,359
location and time Freedom there is

998
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,480
nothing more important to get you there

999
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:26,599
than having a mentor Aristotle had a

1000
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,680
mentor Plato had a mentor Alexander the

1001
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:30,640
Great had a mentor and if they all

1002
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,480
needed mentors saying that you're

1003
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,200
special and you don't need anyone is

1004
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,200
simply lying to yourself and then we go

1005
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,280
back to the mentorship Paradox you see

1006
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,280
for a mentor to be a good Mentor they

1007
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,720
have to be successful which means

1008
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,079
they're going to be more expensive than

1009
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:49,160
you can afford so what do you

1010
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,480
do well that was the exact problem I

1011
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,960
fixed with educate what you get inside

1012
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,480
of educate is essentially more than 20

1013
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:59,040
plus mentors at a huge discount we

1014
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,880
created what we call an educator and

1015
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,640
inside of educate you'll get access to

1016
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,240

1017
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:08,839

to get access to any one of those

1044
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,359

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,800
of thousands of dollars weekly I mean we

1046
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:14,560

00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,000

1060
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:46,480

1064
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,880
figure out everything out on your own

1065
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:56,000
then after they help you decide what's

1066
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,119
the best path for you they will draw a

1067
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,960
customized action plan to your specific

1068
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:01,680
situation on the step- by- step that you

1069
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,160
need to follow in order to achieve

1070
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,200
success and become a free person with

1071
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,240
whatever curriculum that you choose

1072
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,960
these mentors understand the market

1073
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,960
better than anyone else and that's

1074
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,079
because every single day they talk to

1075
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,480
dozens of students they get to see

1076
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,040
what's working and what isn't right now

1077
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,920
and I was chatting with our lead

1078
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,720
educator the other day he told me that

1079
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,200
every single student that had worked

1080
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,839
with him for 6 months was making money

1081
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,680
as in every single student that showed

1082
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,760
up to the calls the calls by the way

1083
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,079
that are included they're free it's not

1084
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,640
like every time you jump on the call

1085
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:34,400
with your onetoone educator and your

1086
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,720
onetoone Mentor you need to pay extra

1087
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,960
money so just simply the people who

1088
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,079
bothered to show up to the calls made

1089
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,040
money and that's why every single

1090
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,319
successful person out there says that

1091
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,319
having mentors is the shortcut to

1092
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:51,079
success if you just follow what they

1093
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:53,119
tell you you get results period now it

1094
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:55,520
is true the most difficult part of this

1095
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,839
entire journey is just getting rid of

1096
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,520
all of your limiting beliefs in the

1097
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:01,800
first place and throughout the years I

1098
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:04,359
have seen it over and over people who

1099
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,440
had so much potential but never achieved

1100
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:10,079
any Real Results due to the limiting

1101
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:12,680
beliefs that stop them so I decided to

1102
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,640
do something I've created a new program

1103
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:17,319
that sole purpose is to help you un your

1104
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:20,160
life before you even think about

1105
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:22,599
becoming successful because at the end

1106
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,240
of the day you won't ever be successful

1107
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:26,079
if you don't address the road blocking

1108
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,839
obstacles that stop you from getting

1109
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,760
there in the first place now this is the

1110
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,720
first program that I've recorded in 2

1111
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,280
years and you're going to get exclusive

1112
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,920
access to it with your educate

1113
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,480
subscription it's called digital

1114
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,520
Launchpad and with it you'll finally be

1115
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,319
able to get rid of the Decades of social

1116
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,040
conditioning you've been fed by the

1117
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:47,400
conditioning Factory and eliminate your

1118
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:49,880
limiting beliefs for life now the last

1119
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,599
principle you need here is self-control

1120
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,599
and self-discipline and I've already

1121
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,760
told you the best way to achieve that by

1122
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,280
immersing yourself in an intense period

1123
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,000
of work now throughout the years I've

1124
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,640
noticed that the people who take this

1125
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,760
plan and immerse themselves completely

1126
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,599
into doing it for a whole month every

1127
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,160
single day while their odds of

1128
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,960
succeeding are exponentially higher than

1129
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,280
the ones who try to do it over long

1130
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,000
periods of time without ever going all

1131
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,920
in and that's really because you learn

1132
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,200
so much faster when you immerse yourself

1133
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,400
completely in a subject without giving

1134
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,720
any room for distractions and not only

1135
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,200
that but the amount of results you

1136
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,079
produce in one month when you go all in

1137
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,079
is greater than you'd produce in 6

1138
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:31,240
months just half assing it I mean just

1139
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:33,240
think about it Navy Seals are considered

1140
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,599
to be the best Special Forces Unit there

1141
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,520
is and they are only the best because

1142
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,319
their training is the most intense there

1143
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,839
is they are forged through intensity and

1144
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,720
just like most precious stones are

1145
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:46,000
created under the most intense

1146
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,640
conditions extreme temperature extreme

1147
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,640
pressure intensity forges longlasting

1148
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,000
success and what we figured out is that

1149
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,520
if a student gets into educate and they

1150
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,680
don't go through the first phase of the

1151
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,880
curriculum within AEK week then their

1152
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,119
odds of succeeding drops by 10x and

1153
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,680
that's because they already lost track

1154
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,160
of the intensity they didn't go all in

1155
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,960
listen it's the exact same thing with

1156
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,800
going to the gym let's say you pay for a

1157
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,640
gym subscription but you don't show up

1158
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,960
on the first week what are the odds of

1159
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,079
you showing up in the weeks after that

1160
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,280
it is way lower than it was of you

1161
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:21,119
showing up in the first week so pretty

1162
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,400
much just by not showing up in the first

1163
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,560
week you already walked 80% of your way

1164
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,119
to failure on the other hand what if you

1165
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,280
showed up every every single day of the

1166
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,560
first 6 weeks that you joined the gym

1167
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,720
first of all you'd already start seeing

1168
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,359
your first small wins in progress during

1169
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,720
that period which would get you even

1170
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:38,560
more committed to showing up then

1171
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,839
knowing that you already showed up every

1172
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,560
day of the first 6 weeks and already

1173
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:44,680
started seeing your first signs of

1174
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,920
progress How likely would you be able to

1175
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:50,280
keep showing up in the coming weeks very

1176
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:52,880
likely I mean pretty much 100% odds and

1177
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,280
almost 2 years ago I created a secret

1178
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,680
program for our students that aimed at

1179
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,560
doing exactly that that providing them

1180
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,880
with an intense start that would

1181
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,319
FasTrack their way to success and still

1182
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,680
to this day this has been the program

1183
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,160
that has generated the best and fastest

1184
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,440
student results that we've ever gotten

1185
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,319
it consisted of six live master classes

1186
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,720
with our best Educators during the

1187
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:17,839
course of 6 weeks each week would cover

1188
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,599
one step of our curriculum and give

1189
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:22,200
students the exact action plan they

1190
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:24,359
needed to execute on during that week

1191
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,359
and at the end of the 6 weeks they would

1192
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:29,079
be ready to start making their first

1193
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:30,680
commissions online in fact quite a few

1194
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:32,559
students started signing clients and

1195
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,119
making money even before the end of the

1196
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:38,240
6 weeks and for the first time ever I've

1197
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:40,800
decided to relaunch this program inside

00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:43,119

straight out of high school as well as

1228
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,760

00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:21,440
of our curriculums agency Navigator sixf

digital Launchpad as well as the 20

1246
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,559
weekly mentorship sessions with our

1250
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:36,280
educate FastTrack basically everything

1251
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,040
that we just discussed the total price

1252
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,040
for this new package would be in the

1253
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,400
tens of thousands of dollars if you were

1254
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,280
to buy each one of these things

1255
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,359
separately especially because of all of

1256
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,040
the mentorship hours you get on a weekly

1257
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,559
basis and it's not one of those fake

1258
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,040
inflated prices that no one's actually

1259
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:51,800
paid for again we've had tens of

1260
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,559
thousands of students join just agency

1261
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,359
navigator for $1,500 as well as more

1262
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:59,440
recently people paying upwards of

1263
00:44:56,359 --> 00:45:01,079
$25,000 for a 3-day event with the exact

1264
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,200
same Educators and to be honest if you

1265
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:04,839
were to pay $10,000 for this package it

1266
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,760
would be a steal knowing that our

1267
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:09,119
average student gets their first paying

1268
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:12,480
Clan within 67 days and they usually

talk to you and solve any issues the

1320
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:59,200
fact is time is is ticking and the

1321
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:01,480
window of opportunity to escape stage 4

1322
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,200
conditioning is shrinking by the minute

1323
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,359
we have reached the point where most of

1324
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,359
our freedoms are on the verge of being

1325
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:09,559
restricted and the longer we stay in

1326
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:12,200
this situation the closer we get to

1327
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:14,440
total control and when that happens none

1328
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:17,760
of what we just discussed will be useful

1329
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:20,160
anymore so either you free yourself now

1330
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,720
or you regret your decisions later this

1331
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,920
is your last chance of escaping the

1332
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:28,559
conditioning Factory and becoming an

1333
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:30,680
outsider so I suggest you act now

1334
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,480
because tomorrow might be too late and

1335
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,119
let's be real Black Friday is in two

1336
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,680
weeks and you can either spend your

1337
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:39,000
hard-earned money buying useless sh that

1338
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:41,559
will only consume even more of your

1339
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,880
already scarce time or you can use the

1340
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:45,240
same money to invest into something

1341
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,559
which is actually going to take you

1342
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,559
somewhere and by the way you literally

1343
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:51,240
have no Financial Risk of joining

1344
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:53,280
educate today and that's because we

1345
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:55,760

1346
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,079
decided to implement a 100% money back

1347
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,960
guarantee so if for whatever reason you

1348
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,440
don't like the program all you have to

1349
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,400
do is email support asking for a refund
