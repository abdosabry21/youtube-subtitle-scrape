1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,759
listen to me very closely because you

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,099
have two choices when it comes to AI you

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,219
can either adopt it or you can get left

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,440
behind but here's the problem with all

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,020
the news coming out about AI seemingly

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,699
every new AI will be the next big thing

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,720
that will take everyone to the next

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:23,939
level but that's simply not true here's

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,279
the reality of the situation most of the

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,199
AI tools that everyone swears by will

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,019
not help you in any meaningful way I

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,600
mean sure they're cool they're nice to

13
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,520
have but besides that they're not really

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,920
gonna help you now

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,140
here's what I mean an AI tool should

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,480
either make you more money or it should

17
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,059
save you more time AI tools should make

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,160
your workflow seamless not add

19
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,860
complexity to them so in today's video

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,500
I'm going to give you the seven AI Tools

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,000
in order to do that now the first AI

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,340
tools that have the potential to make

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,660
you lots of money and save you lots of

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,340
time are 10 web.io and durable.co now

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,979
back in the day creating a website

26
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,720
required a lot of skills and training I

27
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,700
mean you need to be proficient in

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,439
several coding languages and you also

29
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,479
had to design everything and then you

30
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,240
needed to write each piece of code

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,159
manually and only then would you be able

32
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,900
to actually fill in a page with your

33
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,340
copy I mean this entire process could

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,560
take weeks sometimes even months

35
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,020
depending on the complexity of the

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,360
website it was a long arduous and most

37
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,759
importantly expensive process and in the

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,439
late 90s even the most basic website

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,080
could cost upwards of twenty thousand

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,840
dollars then came tools like WordPress

41
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,079
and later Wix and Shop Shopify and these

42
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,299
tools drastically brought costs down and

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,060
all of a sudden most people could build

44
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,520
at least a very basic website but even

45
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,520
since these came out in the 2000s one

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,140
problem has still remained time no

47
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,140
matter how you put it building a good

48
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,479
website however simple will still take a

49
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,979
long time I mean sure nowadays you don't

50
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,780
have to code everything yourself you can

51
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,060
kind of just put in whatever you want

52
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,860
into a website builder but even then it

53
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,840
still takes time it takes time to get

54
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,179
the design right it takes time to write

55
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,920
the copy it even takes time to learn how

56
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,680
to use the website Builders themselves

57
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,959
so much so that agencies and contractors

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,819
will offer to do it for you and let's be

59
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,920
honest lots of the custom websites are

60
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:22,500
actually just slightly improved versions

61
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,420
of basic Wix templates so that's really

62
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,520
all to say that building websites isn't

63
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,560
easy and it isn't quick and that's

64
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,739
really where AI comes into the picture

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,840
with tools like 10 web.io and durable

66
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:36,540
you can use AI to build your entire

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,480
website for you and I will design it

68
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,519
build it write copy and even source and

69
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,019
insert the imagery and in a matter of

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,420
minutes you can go from having no

71
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:47,940
website to having a fully functioning

72
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,519
and aesthetically pleasing website all

73
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,879
you need to do is give AI some basic

74
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,819
information and that's it a few minutes

75
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,379
answering prompts if that and you'll

76
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:00,840
also be able to take advantage of

77
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:03,660
features like built-in SEO and AI

78
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,120
Recreation AI Recreation allows you to

79
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,580
feed the AI websites you like and it can

80
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,200
recreate similar websites for you now of

81
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,879
course once made you can edit whatever

82
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,280
you want and even have the tool

83
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,440
regenerate the site until it's to your

84
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,420
Perfection and your liking so you can

85
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,099
either use these AI Tools in your own

86
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,560
business or you can even start

87
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,360
businesses around them you see tons of

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,519
people are paying Freelancers a few

89
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,620
hundred dollars to make really basic

90
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,780
websites and with these tools you can

91
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,360
blow those Freelancers out of the water

92
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,060
in a matter of minutes and even command

93
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,980
higher prices while doing so these are

94
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,680
perfect examples of how AI tools can

95
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,599
both save time and make you money now

96
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,879
over the years our attention span has

97
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,400
gone in shorter and shorter and creators

98
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,019
have to grab attention faster and faster

99
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,540
and that eventually led to our current

100
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,459
reality where short form content is King

101
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,620
now there's multiple ways to go about

102
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,720
short form and I would know because over

103
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,599
the last year I've had 20 full-time

104
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,120
editors full full-time strictly doing

105
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,980
short form content for me now obviously

106
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,420
that's super expensive we have a full

107
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,360
department for it we have a department

108
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,099
lead and it's simply not an option for

109
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,920
most people and that's where a tool is

110
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:16,139
like Opus clip become extremely useful

111
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,840
you see Opus clip is able to take any

112
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,940
long-form video and with one click turn

113
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,100
your long form content into short form

114
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,620
content now the best part about this

115
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,780
tool is that the AI is able to find the

116
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,180
best hooks in the video and piece them

117
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,979
together with the relevant highlights to

118
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,960
pretty much cut out all of the boring

119
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:36,780
stuff and that means that your chances

120
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,120
of virality are much much higher and the

121
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,880
AI copilot also allows you to clip parts

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,160
of a video based on keywords now this is

123
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,720
easily one of the highest Roi tools on

124
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,120
this list especially considering how

125
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,520
prevalent short form content is and you

126
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,100
know as well as I the short form is not

127
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,900
going anywhere tools like Opus clip can

128
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,240
not only save you time in editing and

129
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,340
money in hiring but you can also build a

130
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,259
business around it of course by now the

131
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,000
industry is no stranger to short form

132
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,680
agencies but just because there are

133
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,600
plenty of them doesn't mean that they no

134
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,120
longer work that means that tools like

135
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,100
Opus can actually make you tons and tons

136
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,560
of money and attract millions and

137
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,780
millions of eyeballs now the next AI

138
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,840
tool helps you save time and actually

139
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,479
simplifies your workflow using chat gbt

140
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,300
writer now chat GPT writer is so simple

141
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:26,639
yet such a no-brainer and here's why

142
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,680
you'll remember that when chat gbt first

143
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,259
became the Talk of the Town one of the

144
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,660
Prime use cases for AI was to do simple

145
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,160
writing tasks but there's one slight

146
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,860
problem by the time that you get an

147
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,840
email open chat gbt copy and paste the

148
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,520
email write the prompt to read and reply

149
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,860
to email you know once you set up all

150
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,479
the Fundamentals by that time frame it

151
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,060
probably would have been quicker to just

152
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:50,639
reply email yourself and that's where

153
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,979
chat gbt writer comes in it's a simple

154
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,960
chat GPT based Chrome extension that

155
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,360
alleviates all of that friction with

156
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,639
using AI to reply to emails it's

157
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,380
incredibly simple yet very effective in

158
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,479
saving time in a long

159
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,240
now next I want to talk about tidio now

160
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,699
tidio's ai lero has the power to either

161
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,280
assist or entirely replace your support

162
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,259
team and doing all that whilst boosting

163
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,759
sales on your website and obviously this

164
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,280
means that you either save money by

165
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,380
hiring less staff or make more money by

166
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,900
providing a better customer experience

167
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,600
and both of those lead to the same

168
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:28,080
outcome which is more net income in your

169
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,419
pocket now tidio ai is essentially an AI

170
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,300
powered chat bot that can do two things

171
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:35,580
it either replaces lengthy frequently

172
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,740
asked questions and answers customers

173
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,600
questions in a matter of seconds so that

174
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,460
means that you can easily increase your

175
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,039
site's conversion rates by making the

176
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,720
customer Journey so much more seamless

177
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,460
because listen instead of clogging the

178
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,020
website with tons of frequently asked

179
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,180
questions and still having loads of

180
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,400
questions unanswered you can now feed

181
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,560
all of that information into AI which

182
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,139
can then answer all of your customers

183
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,539
queries the AI can also answer more

184
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:03,419
advanced queries like order fulfillment

185
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:05,639
or restocks by tapping into the database

186
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:08,039
now the second thing the AI allows is

187
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,780
for human customer support team to work

188
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,000
faster and better you see here's the

189
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,740
thing tidio is a text-based AI which

190
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,020
means it can take your support agents

191
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,020
quick and rough replies and turn them

192
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,300
into full sentences that are on par with

193
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,039
your company's branding but if your

194
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,720
customer asks a question that's beyond

195
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,479
the scope of the ai's knowledge base

196
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,060
then it will automatically refer them to

197
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:32,819
a human agent now here's the interesting

198
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,039
part lero can answer 70 of your

199
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,380
customers questions that means that your

200
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,740
support system can service more people

201
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,860
in less time and as I said the result is

202
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:47,160
happier customers and ultimately more

203
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,960
sales so the next AI tool will be useful

204
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,419
for just about anyone and have the

205
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,039
potential to save tons of time now have

206
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:55,440
you ever read through a seemingly

207
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,060
endless contract or some other lengthy

208
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,099
document now maybe you have to do some

209
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,259
reading for a class or maybe you need to

210
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:03,000
read some other brief or report for work

211
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:04,800
well well if you've ever been in a

212
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,440
situation where you have to read a long

213
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,479
document then doc you ask can save you a

214
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,280
ton of time because with Doc you ask you

215
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,440
no longer need to read those long

216
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,199
arduous documents you see there are

217
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,479
plenty of tools that summarize text chat

218
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,340
gbt can even do that but the issue with

219
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,259
the summaries is that they're only that

220
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:25,139
summaries that means that you will

221
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:27,240
inevitably miss important fine details

222
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,800
but if you know what to look for well

223
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,039
then you can use a doc you ask because

224
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,380
docu ask takes any document and analyzes

225
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,419
it so you can simply ask questions about

226
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,459
it in a chat box listen here's the thing

227
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,979
extracting information from documents

228
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:42,719
literally could not be easier so you no

229
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,120
longer need to spend hours and hours

230
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,420
scouring through documents you can

231
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,220
simply use AI now the next AI is one

232
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:54,060
that I've mentioned in a previous video

233
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,920
but it may just be the most useful AI on

234
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,560
this list and that's Microsoft's

235
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,779
co-pilot copilot directly complements

236
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,399
Microsoft's entire Suite of products

237
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,980
that means it's a able to do everything

238
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,260
from analyzing Excel spreadsheets to

239
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,360
making full-blown PowerPoints I mean

240
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,640
copilot can even transcribe notes during

241
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,800
a Microsoft team meeting and provide you

242
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,320
with a summary of the key points and

243
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,600
action items and even execute on the

244
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,420
actions itself so let's say one of those

245
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,100
action items was to make a presentation

246
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:25,620
copilot is able to create a tailor-made

247
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,600
presentation to your desired branding

248
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,220
guidelines I mean we've all made a

249
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,459
PowerPoint presentation before that

250
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,959
alone could literally save you hours

251
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:36,180
copilot also knows your calendar and

252
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:38,220
therefore can prepare you for upcoming

253
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,320
meetings it can even generate reports

254
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,959
and other word documents based on

255
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,580
previous work and of course it can also

256
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,100
reply to all of your emails for you

257
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,620
copilot is one of the best examples of

258
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,380
AI making your workflow more seamless

259
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,480
and more efficient it's an AI tool that

260
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,880
anyone can take advantage of regardless

261
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,920
of their occupation and especially if

262
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,140
you ever use one of Microsoft's products

263
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,880
well then copilot will be useful to you

264
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,160
whether you need to make a pitch deck

265
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,740
for your clients or analyze last

266
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,080
quarter's profitability co-pilot can

267
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,660
help the last tool I want to talk about

268
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,899
is Adobe Firefly because Adobe Firefly

269
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,519
is one of the craziest AI tools yet you

270
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:19,740
see most of the other tools on this list

271
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,500
simply save you time or money by doing

272
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,660
tasks for you for example 10 web and

273
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,760
durable make websites for you tidio

274
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,959
answers your customers questions and

275
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,240
they basically give you leverage

276
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,459
Leverage is really what makes AI so

277
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,560
powerful to begin with you see prior to

278
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:37,380
AI you'd have to spend hours on a task

279
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,620
or spend money to hire someone to spend

280
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,360
hours on that exact task now well now

281
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,700
you essentially have an employee for a

282
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,920
fraction of the cost but Adobe Firefly

283
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,019
doesn't fall under that same

284
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,540
umbrella you see Adobe Firefly actually

285
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:53,820
allows you to do things that otherwise

286
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,920
would never have been possible and in

287
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,140
the process of that this AI is

288
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,300
incredibly valuable not only can you

289
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,339
make it make your work easier but you

290
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,500
can also make it a hundred times better

291
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:06,839
which of course will make you more money

292
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,000
so let me explain how it works Firefly

293
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,220
is a generative AI powered content

294
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,079
creation tool that means it can simply

295
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,540
create things so let's look at three

296
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:18,060
examples and how it can help you fire

297
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,220
fly can create realistic images from

298
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,440
detailed text and this is incredibly

299
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,200
useful if you need any sort of product

300
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,880
photography or any other scenario where

301
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,980
you need to depict something now

302
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,019
normally you need a whole team of

303
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,360
graphic designers and artists whereas

304
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:35,160
now you can simply ask the AI to do it

305
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,500
for you and that means you're able to

306
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,720
elevate your work drastically without

307
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,399
elevating your costs the second thing is

308
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,260
Firefly has something called generative

309
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,980
fill and that means that it can either

310
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:48,660
draw in or erase objects in a photo so

311
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,060
if you want to wear a different outfit

312
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,620
in a certain photo this AI can do that

313
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,600
for you it can do things that would

314
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,240
otherwise be impossible or would have

315
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,279
taken a Photoshop expert to do even then

316
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,260
Firefly does in a way that looks

317
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,320
completely natural it can also turn your

318
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:06,540
sketches into photorealistic images and

319
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,120
so much more so if you work with any

320
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:12,480
sort of content creation Firefly will be

321
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,760
a must-have tool both for easy fixes and

322
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,560
for exploring completely new ideas and

323
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,260
soon Firefly will even be able to

324
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,720
generate images from 3D elements now

325
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,579
here's the bottom line This AI

326
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,740
Revolution we're in is no different from

327
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:28,079
any other technological Revolution and

328
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,300
as with any boom there will be an

329
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,700
inevitable bust the key here is to be

330
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,800
able to discern what's to stay and what

331
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,200
isn't and then to capitalize on the

332
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,760
trends that are here to stay and now

333
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,220
that you have these seven tools to help

334
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,500
you make money and save time all you

335
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,600
need to do is get to work and as always

336
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,860
I'll be watching from afar

337
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,860
and I'm rooting for you
