1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:08,279
all right so for the first time I'm

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,279
revealing my watch

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,010
collection

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:20,560
yeah's just the best watch brand on

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:23,080
[Music]

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,050
Earth honestly thank you very much I

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,819
already have this watch right

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,819
[Music]

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,360
here

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,600
this is probably half of it I've got

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,360
another 25% of my collection in another

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,879
box just like this here in Dubai and

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,800
then I've got another box like this uh

14
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,480
in London so I also keep some of my

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,960
collection in London so in the watch

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,199
roll I have my four favorite watches in

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,359
my collection at the moment but we'll

18
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,399
save that till the end of the video what

19
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,559
watch would you say you wear the least I

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,320
guess in the half of the collection that

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,280
I have here today probably this rose

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,640
gold Daytona with black dial I've got

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,040
quite a few white gold daytonas there in

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,240
the rest of my collection in the other

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,080
box that doesn't get as much rist time

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,200
and you'll notice that there's still

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,119
quite a few scratches on here and that's

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,880
because any watches that I personally

29
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:19,759
don't wear that much I give to my

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,799
friends to wear so this has gotten a lot

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,360
of risk time on my friends wrists but

32
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,960
for me personally I'm just not a massive

33
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,280
fan of rose gold and white gold daytonas

34
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,479
at least compared to a platinum Daytona

35
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,399
or for example something like this I

36
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,600
love the rose gold Daytona on the oyster

37
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,920
flex and I think it comes down to really

38
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,920
just the way that the bezel pops on the

39
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,880
oyster Flex because they do the ceramic

40
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,880
bezel same as what you'd find on a steel

41
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,920
Daytona rather than the bezel that they

42
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,079
do on the full rose gold so out of these

43
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,680
I'm sure you can understand why I just

44
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:56,399
prefer the pop of color with the oyster

45
00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:00,039
Flex with the steel or for example right

46
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,799
here with the Platinum Daytona which you

47
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:05,719
say is your favorite out of these 100%

48
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,200
Platinum Platinum I remember I requested

49
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,920
this watch from Rolex in 2020 and no one

50
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,879
really wanted them like they want them

51
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,840
now so yeah what can I say it's just

52
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,519
it's there it makes a statement but it

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,720
doesn't need to scream too loud so this

54
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:20,040
is a watch that I love this is a

55
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,840
meteorite Daytona on the oyster Flex

56
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,800
once again just talking about precious

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,000
metals I got offer the meteorite which

58
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,560
is a extremely difficult dial to get I

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,640
got offered it on my chist between a

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,040
full white gold or rose gold bracelet

61
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,840
and I ended up declining that watch

62
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,519
holding out and opting for this instead

63
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,159
I took this watch skiing earlier this

64
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,640
year and I don't know it just felt like

65
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:44,840
the perfect watch like in the snow in

66
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,800
here I have one more I actually wish I'd

67
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,120
put Less daytonas in this Bo I wish I'd

68
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,040
taken some of my other watches uh I have

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,959
one more Daytona white gold blue dial

70
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,680
once again just uh once again what can I

71
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,720
say beautiful watch classic watch

72
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,560
Timeless watch because it's white gold

73
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,200
wow this has a lot of scal I think this

74
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,400
has been with my friends far more than

75
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,280
me so whoever to abuse this watch wow I

76
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,000
didn't realize until now it's definitely

77
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,599
very scuffed up but at least my friends

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,080
got some good enjoyment out of it I

79
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,640
think I have one Vashon in here so this

80
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,159
is the Vashon overseas this is the

81
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,159
second overseas that I have so what I

82
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:23,120
love about this watch which uh is also

83
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:26,680
same with the Cartier

84
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,599
Santos so this is one of my skeletons

85
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,400
this is a steel I've also got a rose

86
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:32,360
gold I don't really wear this watch much

87
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,319
anymore so Alex my head of production

88
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,439
this has basically just been his watch

89
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,760
this entire year so yeah yeah you're

90
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:41,640
you're daily

91
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,239
beater don't worry about it don't worry

92
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,000
about it there'd be chunks out if I was

93
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:46,519
wearing it I'm I'm the worst with it so

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,560
anyways as I was saying the thing I love

95
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,799
about this is just this uh easy uh link

96
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,239
system with the bracelet so you can take

97
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,280
this off as such and then now you've got

98
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,120
the rose gold bracelet off and I don't

99
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,079
have the strap here with me but you can

100
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,239
put like a Navy strap on I've got Navy

101
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:06,799
strap to match the dial I think without

102
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,079
a doubt of any brand this has the most

103
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,879
beautiful blue it's honestly just

104
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,680
mesmerizing I know that sounds like

105
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,200
dramatic but it's you can just look at

106
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,680
it in so many different lights the

107
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,320
Sunburst effect yeah honestly incredible

108
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,239
incredible dial Great brand great watch

109
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,080
and I feel like if you see someone with

110
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,040
a Vashon you know that they're probably

111
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,840
a bit more of a serious collector than

112
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,479
just wearing a royal oak or an allus or

113
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,600
something like that let's talk about

114
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:38,120
that AP this one yeah big boy big boy so

115
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,840
I'm not really a fan of offshores I'd

116
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,840
been offered a couple offshores in the

117
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,160
past was never that interested it's a 42

118
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,280
mm offshore and it's also titanium so

119
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,919
it's very light usually offshores are

120
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,440
very big they're very bulky and fair

121
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:54,479
enough this watch is still very very

122
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,960
bulky but I don't know just quite light

123
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,360
and it's big but it's not a 44 like some

124
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,039
of their other offshores so I just

125
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,600
thought thought you know what I need an

126
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,400
offshore in my collection it doesn't get

127
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,080
that much risk time but sometimes for

128
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,639
example when I'm going on holiday short

129
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,840
little trip somewhere you know this

130
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,639
makes it outside of the watch case show

131
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,840
us

132
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,400
something that is a heavy HIIT okay I'll

133
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,400
give you what other people would

134
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,199
consider I mean there's a lot of Heavy

135
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,000
Hitters in here but like one that people

136
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,039
would most certainly consider a heavy

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,840
hitter and then one that the watch

138
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:30,680
Community uh so this is a 351 this not

139
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,080
the 3502 with the open case back it's

140
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,800
the 01 with the closed case back this

141
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,440
watch is extremely extremely light I

142
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,639
have it on the velcro strap over the

143
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,800
years I've played around with having

144
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,800
this watch with the deployment clasp as

145
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,759
well as some of my other RMS I put them

146
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,080
on deployment clasps but like I always

147
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:49,360
just keep coming back to the velcro I

148
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,960
know it is insane it's absolutely

149
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,880
ridiculous to have a watch that's worth

150
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,440
$300,000 on velcro but that's just

151
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,600
that's RM RM to me is about just not

152
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,360
taking yourself too serious it's

153
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,000
comfortable it's light as I said that's

154
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,000
why I like the velcro that's why I avoid

155
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,479
the deployment clasp so I'd say another

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,639
one that would be considered a heavy

157
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,919
hitter is one of my recent pickups uh

158
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,639
this I've been waiting for for some time

159
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,400
from pek this is a world time but it's

160
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,840
not just any world time it is an enamel

161
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,400
world time so actually just a couple

162
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,080
months ago I was at pp6 which is pect

163
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,720
manufacturing plan and that was a super

164
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,000
cool experience PCH flew me out to

165
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,759
Geneva on the jet I got to spend a

166
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,759
couple days there I got to sit down and

167
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,000
have lunch with their CEO and one of the

168
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:34,800
arms of their manufacturing plant was

169
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,759
their enameling facility so basically I

170
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,880
got to learn about the whole enameling

171
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,319
process and I will say when you go to

172
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,199
the factories of these manufacturers it

173
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,360
genuinely does just give you a totally

174
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,479
new appreciation for these watches so I

175
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,120
definitely say that anyone who's into

176
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,720
horology this would be a heavy hitter

177
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,000
for them so just going back to

178
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,919
complications this is a white gold

179
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Nautilus 5740 I'm not going to sit here

180
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,120
and pretend to be Nico Leonard and know

181
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,400
all the numbers and all the different

182
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,240
reference ref is I am a collector I'm

183
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,560
not an expert so I do want to just make

184
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,000
that clear I'm not going to be able to

185
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,360
tell you too much more about the watch

186
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,199
except for the fact that I believe it's

187
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,960
the most complicated nless it's white

188
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,400
gold and it looks beautiful would you

189
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,639
say it's your favorite out of that box

190
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,840
no no I'd say that out of this box it's

191
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:27,240
probably either the enamel dial or this

192
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,400
which is a rose gold aquanut I adore

193
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,120
rose gold watches and the combination of

194
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,479
rose gold and brown is my favorite

195
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,479
you're going to see one of my watches

196
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,800
here and one of my other watches which

197
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:39,879
is my favorite watch and was my favorite

198
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,680
watch for the longest time the 5711r

199
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,840
rose gold narus until I got something

200
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,680
that's in that watch roll which ended up

201
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,159
beating it as my favorite watch but yeah

202
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,599
when it comes to aquanuts very

203
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:51,479
comfortable I think incredibly

204
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,759
comfortable bracelet I actually find

205
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:55,720
them to be more comfortable than rolex's

206
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,599
oyster Flex that's just me personally

207
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,039
and I just like the low thin profile of

208
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,919
it I just like it when the watches are

209
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,440
just flush and

210
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:06,039
Sleek yeah so I love this watch uh let's

211
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,680
see if we want to go back to Rolex we've

212
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:10,919
got a couple Day dates in here this is

213
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,120
the 60th anniversary green olive dial

214
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,759
this is an example in white gold and

215
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,000
this is an example in rose gold with a

216
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,319
diamond bezel I'm not a massive Diamond

217
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,120
guy to be honest and if it is Diamond

218
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,919
obviously it has to be Factory but I

219
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,360
don't know sometimes it's fun to just

220
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,840
mix up have a little bit little little

221
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,240
pop of shine I'd say that there's still

222
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,879
a lot of stuff that I really need to EXP

223
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:36,640
explore I pretty much only got Rolex PCH

224
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:38,279
Philip rishard Mill AP feron Cartier I

225
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,479
feel like I still have a lot of

226
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,959
collecting to do I lot of moon swatches

227
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,479
I do have a lot of moon swatches that

228
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:44,880
correct I was wearing one when I started

229
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,279
Moon swatches are just cheap they're

230
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,920
just fun I put them on these rubber

231
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:49,920
straps and yeah it's nice if you're ever

232
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,640
in Europe and you don't want to get your

233
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,440
uh arm chopped off it's good little fun

234
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,720
watch to wear uh let's see what else do

235
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,519
we have in here we've got Batgirl some

236
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,240
people like go on the oyster bracelet I

237
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:01,640
personally like go on the the Jubilee I

238
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,920
actually really love this watch I don't

239
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,560
know it's just it's a good watch good

240
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,200
watch Pepsi I think I've already talked

241
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,320
to you guys about this this is a white

242
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,839
gold this is not the steel uh the steel

243
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,880
I believe has a darker dial so yeah

244
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,839
white gold but for 99% of people you

245
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,440
would never be able to tell the

246
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,160
difference rose gold AP once again on

247
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,160
the theme of thin profile watches I just

248
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,600
really love the jumbos because they're

249
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,519
thinner more flush some of the AP cases

250
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,720
can get kind of big which is great for

251
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,320
certain occasions but just dated day I

252
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,720
don't I just like the thinner profile of

253
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,399
it so I've got this watch as well in

254
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,640
Platinum with the green dial and that

255
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,120
watch is crazy watch super difficult

256
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,560
super difficult watch to get and then

257
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,720
let's see the last one to talk about

258
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,040
here is probably this which is the

259
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,880
5205g this a white gold piece from pek

260
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,839
at the moment I've got on this sort of

261
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,760
canvas e strap I've had this watch for

262
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,120
maybe four years three 3 years four

263
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,800
years at this point once again it's got

264
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,360
this blue Sunburst dial Great watch

265
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,320
beautiful beautiful 38 mm so a little on

266
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,680
the smaller size for my wrist but it's

267
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,240
it's just Timeless it's a Timeless size

268
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,320
is going to be appropriate and hold its

269
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:13,800
own so yeah this is gray watch and then

270
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,959
now getting into my favorite pieces in

271
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,880
my watch collection at the moment

272
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:20,519
obviously as a collector that changes

273
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,880
month by month but they are some Heavy

274
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,640
Hitters I will I will say that so these

275
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,680
are the four watches that have been in

276
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,279
my rotation the most and gone the most

277
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:33,079
risk time as of late this is my favorite

278
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:34,600
watch Ever if I had to have one watch

279
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:37,560
for the rest of my life it would be this

280
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,639
it is the 5712r it took everything that

281
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,240
I loved about the 5711r and just made it

282
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,200
even better one big thing that they

283
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,000
added on this is the extension so if you

284
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,519
press here and you can do it on both

285
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,200
sides it can make the watch longer it

286
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,320
can make the bracelet longer and

287
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,200
obviously that is very useful on hot

288
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,680
days you can you know increase the

289
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,360
extension then that gives you some extra

290
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,000
wrist space right now it's quite cold so

291
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,360
this slides back back quite a lot for me

292
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,600
I don't know what it is but with pek

293
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,040
like sometimes I feel it's inappropriate

294
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,600
to wear rose gold in certain situations

295
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,639
but like I don't know why with this

296
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,279
watch I just feel like it's not

297
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,200
screaming like I just feel like it's so

298
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,200
elegant so even though it is rose gold

299
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,240
even though it can be perceived to some

300
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:21,240
people as flashy for me it's just

301
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:24,480
stuning what a watch what a watch this

302
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,519
is a platinum DayDay this exact

303
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,000
configuration this has the baguette

304
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,920
bezel and it also has the baguette

305
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,480
markers you know it's got some ice on

306
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,800
here I just think it's incredible I know

307
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,639
it's got some diamonds on here but I

308
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,880
still feel like it's appropriate it's

309
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,440
not like that crazy it's it's still in a

310
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,000
way elegant and I just think it's

311
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,639
beautifully balanced there's certain

312
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,880
Watchers that you just look at and

313
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,040
you're like this works this makes sense

314
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,480
and I'd say this is definitely one of

315
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,440
those watches where it's just very well

316
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:56,639
balanced now the next watch is

317
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,360
incredible absolutely incredible this is

318
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,040
a Celestial there's a couple minute

319
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,560
repeaters that I'm eyeing up I I think

320
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,800
that'll probably be my next dress watch

321
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,240
from pek is a minute repeater but

322
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,399
outside of that I'd say this is probably

323
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,160
my favorite dress watch now this is a 44

324
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,680
mm watch it's a large dress watch so a

325
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,639
lot of people it just won't work for

326
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,880
them once again because I have larger

327
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:19,320
wrists this still works this is

328
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,839
definitely not a watch you're going to

329
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,959
see often there's definitely not many

330
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:23,760
people that want to be spending this

331
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:25,760
sort of money for a dress watch that

332
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,839
like no one knows what it is and this is

333
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,399
definitely a collector's piece but it's

334
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,040
incredible to be able to look up the sky

335
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,959
and know exactly where the constellation

336
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,600
is and where all the stars are placed

337
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,480
and that perfectly matches your watch

338
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,040
yeah it's just an insane complication

339
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,560
insane watch and the last watch is a

340
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,199
watch that has been in my rotation ever

341
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,560
since I got it I was in love with it and

342
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,519
even when I first started getting into

343
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,160
rard Mill this was the watch that from

344
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:53,800
day one I told him that I wanted this is

345
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,440
a 6702 and they have a few variations of

346
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,360
it this is the Zev I believe and this

347
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,639
watch is so insanely light but as you're

348
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,160
going to see as is a theme with a lot of

349
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:06,079
my other watches I like thin profile

350
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,279
watches so this is RM this gives you

351
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,760
that comfortability that lightness that

352
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:12,360
you get with rard Mill but without you

353
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,519
know that extra chunkiness so for

354
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,560
example if you take it compared to the

355
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,760
351 just check that out you know you can

356
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,959
see how much extra the 3501 protrudes

357
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,279
out compared to the 6702 yeah stunning

358
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:26,880
watch huh so ladies and gentlemen that

359
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,720
is my watch collection I started

360
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,760
collecting watches in 201 18 when I was

361
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,760
18 years old I'd made my first million

362
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,839
doll from the business and I basically

363
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,560
had been collecting ever since and I was

364
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,240
collecting even when it wasn't a

365
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,079
financially smart decision when every

366
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,800
single Watch I was buying and I was

367
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:44,519
losing money on that doesn't really

368
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,920
matter I think if you find something

369
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,480
that you are interested in go collect

370
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,760
obviously be sensible and most

371
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,040
importantly buy whatever you're to I

372
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,040
have some of my friends that have just

373
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,959
collections of Omega speed Masters or I

374
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,399
have friends that pretty much only wear

375
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,480
vintage Cartiers so whatever you're into

376
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,320
find out what that is keep working hard

377
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,800
and I think watches are an incredible

378
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,440
way to reward yourself for every chapter

379
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,199
of your life and watches are also an

380
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,639
incredible hobby that you can share with

381
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,120
your friends your loved ones you know

382
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,000
all of my friends wear all my nice

383
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,040
watches cuz I just you know I just don't

384
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
have enough time to wear all of them so

385
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,360
I would much rather they get appreciated

386
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,079
by other people even if there are

387
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,480
scratches or this that like these things

388
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:24,839
are are made to be used and worn so with

389
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,120
all that being said work hard and I'm

390
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:29,320
sure I'll see you with a collection like

391
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,320
