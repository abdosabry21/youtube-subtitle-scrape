1
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,880
here we go baby welcome back to the Vlog

2
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,760
so where are we going we are off to do a

3
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,460
bit of car shopping I think I've said

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,099
this before but what I'm in UK as you

5
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,440
can see most driven in Dubai I'm driven

6
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,899
I'm almost in the back driving in Dubai

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,460
is genuinely stressful so most of the

8
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,320
time I just sit in the back do some work

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,960
make some calls yeah that's day-to-day

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,520
occasion when we go abroad I'll rent out

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,680
some nice supercars some nice sports

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,719
cars have a little bit of fun zip around

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,180
so at the moment all the cars that I own

14
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,840
are all cars that's in the back today

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,039
I'm buying my first ever Supercar well I

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,660
might be buying we're stopping off at

17
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,239
one place then we're gonna go check out

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,980
a few other spots as well see what can

19
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,080
be done how quickly it can be done

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,479
because there is for example one

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,580
specific car I want but it'll take three

22
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,920
to four years and unfortunately I don't

23
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,439
have that time because I need a car in

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,299
one year exactly for a very special

25
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,680
event that I'm very excited for and

26
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,220
actually it might even be a cool

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,020
opportunity for us to hang out and spend

28
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,920
some time around some cool cars but I

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,730
will tell you a little bit more about

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,930
that at the end of the video

31
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,930
[Music]

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,740
I guess we have to wait until then to

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,299
talk about but there's not many people

34
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,920
who buy a car knowing that they're gonna

35
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,920
slap on an aggressive amount of Miles

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,360
pretty quickly so it's only 1500 miles A

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,340
Thousand Miles yeah so I guess that kind

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,780
of changes things you know and that's

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,820
funny like I feel as a listeners the

40
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,220
cars you want to drive for a quick 30 60

41
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,659
minutes I have to consider a few other

42
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,579
things with this purchase you know like

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,510

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,200
half of me on a pet me

76
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,200
oh God

77
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,940
I don't know what we're going about okay

78
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,620
I'll consider it okay if you want

79
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,500
something that's got four months it's

80
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,299
all the Lamborghini drama of v10 or V12

81
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,040
but you want five seats big boot space

82
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,540
this is a car you buy you know what I

83
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,060
think this is probably the only Lambo

84
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,739
I'd own yeah like I'm just probably the

85
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,080
only Lambo I'd buy I have no use for it

86
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,420
but it's because you haven't been in an

87
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,599
event at all I have but it's not driven

88
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,599
it

89
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,620
you think uh the issue is I don't think

90
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,720
it really fits into car rally to be

91
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,760
honest how much money you got a lot how

92
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,159
many problems you got

93
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,680
be honest he's not here be honest yeah

94
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,859
it's you won't you won't drive it I know

95
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,660
you yeah but I will

96
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:24,180
what do you realistically for me it has

97
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,780
to be a Porsche maybe a Ferrari I'm just

98
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:30,780
so aggressively against Lambos

99
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,860
hey it works does it yeah you know all I

100
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,419
need now Lamborghini I bet me no

101
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,460
now's a good time for me to explain why

102
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,139
I actually need my first Supercar so as

103
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,199
you guys know I don't do any in-person

104
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,580
events I don't do Keynotes speeches I

105
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,560
got so much that comes across my table

106
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,820
this is the first thing in so long that

107
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,680
actually interested me and that's

108
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,540
because I know how incredible of an

109
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,860
entrepreneur John is and I know that

110
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,900
this is just gonna be such a cool chance

111
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,639
to meet so many you guys spend a week

112
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,560
together so now is probably a good time

113
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,880
to actually unveil what this is so maybe

114
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,680
you want to tell them a little bit about

115
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,540
the magic that you've created with Mod

116
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,280
Ball but basically the mob ball it's

117
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,080
been around for 17 years it's like the

118
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,820
craziest week it's like a rolling

119
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,040
Festival last year I went to the Monaco

120
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,840
Grand Prix this year's Ibiza but next

121
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,940
year we're taking it back to the Monaco

122
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,699
Grand Prix because it's so incredible in

123
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,560
the past year what I've seen you do on

124
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,199
YouTube and your social media and your

125
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,840
businesses is like incredibly impressive

126
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,460
and long story short we're partnering up

127
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,160
for next year's event everyone's going

128
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,419
to bring his entire but media side of

129
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,039
things all that kind of stuff and we're

130
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,720
going to bounce ideas off for all the

131
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,699
parties and events so I know that you

132
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,800
like to party every now and again so

133
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:40,500
yeah we're basically joining our brains

134
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,900
together to create the most epic model

135
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,759
in 18 years so for most of you guys this

136
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,020
will be a court opportunity for me to

137
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,580
take you through the Journey of buying

138
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,380
my first Supercar it's gonna be a super

139
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,479
cool week we're going to be touring all

140
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,479
the way through Europe and ending off in

141
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:56,280
Monaco for Grand Prix and Marco Grand

142
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,080
Prix is one of the probably five to ten

143
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,120
events a year that everyone wants to go

144
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,500
to and no one can do it right and not

145
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,960
only that but be there with a hundred

146
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,699
plus other people that have the same

147
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,860
interest in you have the same likes as

148
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,539
you and it's not just that but a week of

149
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,460
traveling with people I mean that's

150
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,419
that's one way to bond and you're

151
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,100
definitely going to leave with a very

152
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,539
special connection with all the people

153
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,280
who attend it's good you mentioned that

154
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,720
because obviously we're opening up 150

155
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,979
slots but for the hundreds of other

156
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,539
thousands that watch this but

157
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,580
unfortunately you know don't have the

158
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:24,660
financial means to attend this yet and

159
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,280
by the way this is something that can be

160
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,199
aspirational you guys can actually come

161
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,880
and we'll make it known where we're

162
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,699
stopping off in which cities and you can

163
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,800
basically come and see a 150 incredible

164
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,940
supercars speak to the owners I'm sure

165
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,860
that if you ask the owners of these

166
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,240
supercars hey what did you do how do you

167
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,199
end up in this position you know can you

168
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,400
tell me a little bit about your story

169
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,199
you know you're going to end up meeting

170
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,240
so many interesting characters along the

171
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,860
way so one of the things I've always

172
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,960
wanted to do on mobile because we have

173
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,180
like a we have a Great Gatsby pie during

174
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,300
the week and in Monaco we can have a

175
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:56,220
charity vote and I would love love to

176
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,840
raise a million dollars somehow for

177
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,280
charity it's a little bit about how you

178
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,500
can get involved bear in mind it will be

179
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,720
application process this is similar to

180
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,100
any serious business Mastermind of

181
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,240
course we're gonna go we're gonna have a

well listen uh I mean there's 101 things

285
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,079
I want to say but as you guys know I

286
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,600
don't have much family that's basically

287
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,640
just me and my mom only child and and

288
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,680
you know when I was younger I found that

289
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,680
very difficult I found it very tough

290
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,700
just being me myself and I I'm sure you

291
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,800
know maybe some of you guys have

292
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,360
brothers or sisters but maybe you felt a

293
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,140
little alone and you felt like you know

294
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,700
maybe

295
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,260
you don't have your tribe or the people

296
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,940
that had your back no matter what you

297
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,920
know as you mentioned the people who you

298
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,540
know you'd go to war with I always say

299
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,880
this I think loyalty to me is such a big

300
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,899
thing and I think I know from the bottom

301
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,180
of my heart that we all have each

302
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,860
other's back and I know from all my

303
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,680
heart that we would all go to war for

304
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,260
each other that's why you know it's

305
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,300
listening to do some incredible things

306
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:48,240

307
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:50,339

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,600
tell you out of everything for me the

309
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,820
