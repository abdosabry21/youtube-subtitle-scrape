dollars a month as a student the only

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,380
issue is there's a lot of BS out there

there's a lot of misinformation and

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,400
there's a lot of people making it seem a

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,139
lot easier than it actually is so in

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,439
components but after you finish watching

this video I'm Gonna Leave a link in the

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,340
description and that link will take you

16
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,440
to my most popular video so far this

17
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,540
year on YouTube that video breaks down

18
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,820
the seven to eight most popular online

19
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,280
business models and will help you break

20
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,620
down and figure out what will work the

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,180
best for you this year now the first

22
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,100
thing you need in order to hit ten

23
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,719
thousand dollars a month as a student is

24
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,219
the right vehicle and let me tell you

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,320
what I mean you see the thing is you

26
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,960
need a means you need an opportunity

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,520
that is big enough but not too risky you

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,379
can actually achieve ten thousand

29
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,760
dollars a month as a student now I will

30
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,079
say that ten thousand dollars a month

31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,120
and I'm really not trying to be

32
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,979
insensitive here I understand that I was

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,720
a fringe case I hit ten thousand dollars

34
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,520
a month when I was 17 years old but I'm

35
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,380
gonna talk about that a little later on

36
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,939
in this video and how I actually got to

37
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,560
that place I had ten thousand dollars a

38
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,900
month when I was 17 years old and by the

39
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,360
end of that year before I turned 18 I

40
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,640
was hitting 30 to 40 000 a month so I'm

41
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,920
speaking here from experience you need a

42
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,540
vehicle a way that you can make that

43
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,220
sort of money but a way in which you're

44
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,840
not gonna risk losing all of the money

45
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,299
that you do have so the first thing that

46
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,860
I will tell you is trading is out the

47
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,540
window I'm gonna be very honest with you

48
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,340
there's a lot of Traders out there that

49
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,960
are trying to sell you BS because when

50
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,000
you sign up with their little affiliate

51
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,799
link and you get your ten dollars free

52
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,360
blah blah blah when you lose money

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,799
that's actually where they make money

54
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,240
they don't make money on the little ten

55
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,920
dollars or twenty dollar sign up that

56
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,360
they get when you join they make money

57
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,220
when you lose they're literally

58
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,720
incentivized for you to lose and listen

59
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,040
that's just the honest truth of it even

60
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,540
if you have a thousand dollars for you

61
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,880
to take a thousand dollars and turn that

62
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,159
into ten or twenty thousand dollars in a

63
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,960
single year is actually very difficult

64
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,460
the amount of success successful trades

65
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,259
the average of all those successful

66
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,119
trades is very very difficult whereas

67
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,459
for you to take a thousand dollars and

68
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,380
invest that into starting a very lean

69
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,000
online business I mean by the end of the

70
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,319
year you're talking tens of thousands of

71
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,879
dollars I don't think realistically

72
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,739
you're gonna hit hundreds of thousands

73
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,080
of dollars in your first year it happens

74
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,340
sometimes but it's very unrealistic but

75
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,200
definitely by the end of the year you

76
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,879
should be making more than your average

77
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,620
salary if you were just working a

78
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,300
traditional nine to five and the best

79
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,640
part is you should be able to do it

80
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,680
remotely so in order to make money you

81
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,540
need something that spits out free cash

82
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
flow and what I mean by that is profit

83
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,000
that you can actually use because here's

84
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,800
the other thing I'm going to tell you

85
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,959
people always look at net worth they go

86
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,819
oh he has 100 million dollars net worth

87
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,680
but his entire net worth is in his

88
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,239
company and he can't take out money out

89
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,800
of his company because he may have

90
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,120
investors or this or that or you have

91
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,620
certain people for example a lot of

92
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,060
people in the property game where they

93
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,560
have a lot of money their portfolio is

94
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,000
worth a lot but they're not very cash

95
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,040
Rich they don't actually have a lot of

96
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,720
cash laying around they're wealthy but

97
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,099
their money is tied up in places and

98
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,720
that's not the place that you want to be

99
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:02,700
at when you're first starting a business

100
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,220
so a lot of businesses like for example

101
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,660
building a proper e-commerce brand and

102
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,519
by the way when I say proper e-commerce

103
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,440
brand once again I'm speaking from

104
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,420
experience I've had an eyewear company

105
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,099
for a few years and the thing is the

106
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,720
packaging Everything Is Beautiful we've

107
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,580
got this beautiful black velvet finish

108
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,260
on the inside so this business is okay

109
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,780
it's my smallest business it makes

110
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,819
around 1.2 to 1.5 million dollars a year

111
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,980
and that sounds great Until you realize

112
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,780
that we have 50 margins so I'm only

113
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,459
keeping 50 of that money and it's even

114
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,739
worse when you realize that any of my

115
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,599
profit that I make I can't keep I have

116
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,920
to roll that into New Stock because

117
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,540
especially a product like this is

118
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,099
actually very difficult to make so for

119
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,500
me to put in an order now of another

120
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:42,299
five thousand to ten thousand units I

121
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,799
may only get that in three four five

122
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,060
months depending on the time of the year

123
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,920
so even though someone would look at him

124
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,959
go that's a 1.5 million dollar a year

125
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,459
business at 50 margins you never

126
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,260
actually get to keep that profit because

127
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,000
you always have to reinvest into the

128
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,739
business and that is very different to

129
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,720
for example a service based business so

130
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,459
if you're offering a service to clients

131
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,440
whether that be building their marketing

132
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,239
funnels whether that be doing their

133
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,159
short form content you know little short

134
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,780
form tick tocks and reels and doing lots

135
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,700
of those and creating many accounts for

136
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,080
them and distributing it all over the

137
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,819
internet all the way to doing for

138
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,620
example their Google ads and focusing

139
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,480
specifically on Google ads for

140
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,639
e-commerce Brands as an example listen

141
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,680
whatever the service is it needs to have

142
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,419
one of two things High perceived value

143
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,620
to the client and what I mean by that is

144
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:24,300
it needs to be something that they're

145
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,340
like oh wow this is actually worth it

146
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,139
I'm more than happy as a business to pay

147
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,759
this external consultant or service

148
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,440
provider a thousand dollars a month

149
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,199
three thousand dollars a month you name

150
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,940
it or it needs to have high leverage and

151
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,740
what I mean by that is listen you can

152
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,820
still be an online personal trainer but

153
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,620
if you want to make ten thousand dollars

154
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,360
a month you need to hire people below

155
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,740
you who work as coaches and that way

156
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,120
you're an online personal trainer and

157
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,740
you do some of the coaching but then you

158
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,060
may have coaches underneath you you know

159
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,040
personal trainers that work with local

160
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,479
gyms and you just pay them a small fee

161
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,460
and they do the rest of coaching so

162
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,380
that's leverage or let's say you have an

163
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,120
agency that creates YouTube thumbnails

164
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,160
for people thumbnails on YouTube are

165
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,259
such an important aspect to video but

166
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,580
people don't pay crazy amounts for

167
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,580
thumbnails but if you can hire someone

168
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,900
in Brazil Romania India for a thousand

169
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,479
dollars a month which is a great salary

170
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,580
there especially remotely and their work

171
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:12,840
is able to produce three four five

172
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,600
thousand dollars a month in terms of

173
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,580
business for your thumbnail agency or

174
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,780
for your thumbnail Performance Marketing

175
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,639
business whatever you want to call

176
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,500
yourself the point is is that that is

177
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,180
leverage that's you being able to take

178
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,220
something off your plate so either you

179
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,900
need to offer a service or guidance

180
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,759
Consulting on something that brings so

181
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,560
much value to businesses that you can

182
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,199
actually make 10K a month just as a

183
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,539
solopreneur or more realistically you'll

184
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,919
be able to do it solo until three four

185
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,419
five thousand dollars a month and then

186
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,039
you need to start using leverage and you

187
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:43,020
need to maybe make a little less on the

188
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,460
margin but make far more money at the

189
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,259
end of the month because you have people

190
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,580
who can deliver these things for you so

191
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,780
just remember with the business models

192
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,400
that I'm talking about you're not going

193
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,720
to make 100 million dollars I'm gonna be

194
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,220
very honest with you but the other thing

195
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,419
that you're not gonna do is you're not

196
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,919
gonna go broke and that's the

197
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,360
unfortunate thing with a lot of these

198
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,160
other businesses for example I'll give

199
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,080
you my main business my software company

200
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,699
that is business that gets into the

201
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,380
multiple nine figures and that's all

202
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,699
cool and fine and well but you need to

203
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,680
realize there's a big chunk of money

204
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,880
needed that I had to put forward to

205
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,440
start the company and that's number one

206
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,840
but then I had the massive competitive

207
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,400
advantage of a massive audience and even

208
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,740
me it took me four years to be like

209
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,300
listen I'm not ready I'm not ready I

210
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,820
don't feel like I have the skill set the

211
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,100
understanding and the sort of influence

212
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,020
to start a business worth hundreds of

213
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,699
millions of dollars so what did I do I

214
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,039
started a service based business back in

215
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,600
2016 and I ran that business for six

216
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,979
years so just remember the business

217
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,120
model that gets you to ten thousand

218
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,560
dollars a month and by the way I

219
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,080
actually managed to get my service based

220
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,940
business up to 150 000 a month in profit

221
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,259
can never get further than that I tried

222
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,819
I'm sure someone else has been able to

223
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,460
do it but for the way that I wanted to

224
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,080
run it which was lean remote no office I

225
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,280
was pretty happy with that so as I was

226
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,500
saying the business that gets you the

227
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,360
10K a month will not necessarily get you

228
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,520
to a hundred million dollars but that's

229
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,440
okay baby steps here choose the right

230
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,940
vehicle for the right career stage

231
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,500
you're at and then the next component to

232
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,360
making ten thousand dollars a month once

233
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,400
you find the right vehicle is stretch

234
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,319
out the timeline and here is the very

235
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,660
unfortunate thing about social media you

236
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,340
see 20 years ago if you were let's say

237
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,020
21 years old and you were making four

238
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,940
thousand dollars a month without having

239
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,860
to go to a traditional nine to five you

240
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,120
would think that you are a king you

241
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,500
would think that you're a baller you

242
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,300
would think that you are killing it and

243
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,000
we live in such a up world where

244
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,740
now you look online and you think I'm 21

245
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,080
years old and I don't work a traditional

246
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,699
nine to five and I have location freedom

247
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,319
and I have time freedom I can wake up

248
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:29,580
whenever I want but I'm only making four

249
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,020
thousand dollars a month I'm not making

250
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,940
ten thousand dollars a month and you

251
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,560
feel depressed because of it how

252
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,639
up is that and by the way I even know

253
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,380
that I have a part to play in that

254
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,360
because what I've been able to do in my

255
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,800
career at my age is not normal but

256
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,960
that's why I always like to tell people

257
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,180
that listen what I've done is very

258
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,580
unrealistic and a third of it was

259
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,380
incredible dedication and hard work a

260
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,000
third of it was timing creating the

261
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,639
right businesses at the right time and

262
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,720
the last third of it was luck or God or

263
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,880
whatever you want to call it whether

264
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,620
you're a person of Faith or not up to

265
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,539
you so I like to make that very clear to

266
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,240
people and then I also like Point people

267
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:04,620
back to 2015 when I was broke and I was

268
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,479
starting a business to take care of me

269
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,460
and my single mom and I was going to the

270
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,259
gym every single day and recording it I

271
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,699
was reading a book a week and putting

272
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,620
out on YouTube so you need to understand

273
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,240
I started my first business my first

274
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,039
Venture and at that point you know I was

275
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,180
really more of a side Hustle but still I

276
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,220
was making a few thousand dollars a

277
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,139
month back in 2014 and granted I only

278
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,520
did that for a few months and then that

279
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,080
business model stopped working and then

280
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,759
I moved to the next thing but really the

281
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,160
point is I was putting in work between

282
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,780
2014 to 2017 and it took me three years

283
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,580
to have my first ten thousand dollars a

284
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,440
month and that's totally fine that's

285
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,880
actually pretty cool if you work as hard

286
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,399
as I did do I think it will take you

287
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,200
three years no because it's so crazy the

288
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,120
internet moves so quickly the back in

289
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,680
2014 I didn't have the opportunities

290
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,660
that you can have today even things like

291
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,519
getting payment processors were so

292
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,140
difficult back then it was it was such a

293
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,120
struggle to even just try to do business

294
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,459
being a 14 year old whereas these days

295
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,839
you have so many more options so do I

296
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,519
think it will take you three years if

297
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,140
you really dedicate pick the right

298
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,339
vehicle follow all of the advice that I

299
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,980
give you in this video do I think that

300
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,740
it will take you 3 years no honestly no

301
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,600
but even if it does who cares I really

302
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,399
cannot stress how vital it is that you

303
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,720
set your expectations to making ten

304
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,240
thousand dollars a month set your

305
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,800
expectation not in months but in years

306
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,600
don't think how many months it's gonna

307
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,339
take me think how many years now here's

308
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,040
the thing if you achieve it quicker

309
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:22,500
Bless you that's amazing I'm over the

310
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,080
moon for you and listen try to get rich

311
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,180
faster of course do it wealth needs to

312
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,680
be built slowly and Welfare is built

313
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,660
over time but try to get rich try to

314
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,580
make as much money as you can ethically

315
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,839
and morally that is but at the end of

316
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,580
the day I'm trying to set these

317
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,140
expectations for you because here's the

318
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,459
thing many of you guys will try and

319
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,140
let's say you're giving your absolute

320
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,880
best for six months and if your

321
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,920
expectations are oh within six months

322
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,540
you know I was expecting to be doing

323
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,339
seven thousand dollars already and

324
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,839
you're only doing twelve hundred dollars

325
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,660
from your online business dude you're

326
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,399
making twelve hundred dollars online do

327
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,779
you realize how amazing that is

328
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,580
and here's the beautiful thing when it

329
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,980
rains it pours and by the way that also

330
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,480
applies negatively and positively in

331
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,740
life and the point here here is this is

332
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,540
usually how business works and this is

333
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,279
what I can tell you now coming up to 10

334
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,720
years since I started my first side

335
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,459
hustle and getting to a point where I

336
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,800
have a conglomerate of businesses and

337
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:12,240
over 150 employees the way it works is

338
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,040
usually something like this it goes like

339
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,600
this and you Flatline for the longest

340
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,399
time and right as you're thinking like

341
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,080
am I just gonna be stuck here forever it

342
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,519
shoots up and then you Flatline it

343
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,019
shoots up and by the way within these

344
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,220
points you have little down moments and

345
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,959
stuff like that but the point is there's

346
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,940
a lot of flat lining there's a lot of

347
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,620
you getting to a new level in life and

348
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,720
then really cementing it really setting

349
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,220
that foundation so I wanted to make this

350
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,080
clear and I wanted to make this one of

351
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,940
the other components just so that way

352
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,680
your expectations are clear they're in

353
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,440
the right place and so you don't quit

354
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,000
before you even properly try now the

355
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,380
last component to making ten thousand

356
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,640
dollars a month and it's kind of like if

357
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,980
you're running a marathon I would much

358
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,140
rather tell people that hey on Mile 18

359
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,880
that's really going to be the tough mile

360
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,220
that's really where things are gonna get

361
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,200
rough because at least when you face

362
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,880
something if you have context beforehand

363
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,500
it makes it a little easier and you feel

364
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,019
less alone so I want to give you guys

365
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,940
context not only for how to get to 10K

366
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:05,040
but what happens once you hit 10K you

367
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,200
see the third component is not just

368
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,240
getting there it's staying there you see

369
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,620
making 10 000 a month and once again I'm

370
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,540
really trying my best not to be

371
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,640
insensitive here I get it I have done it

372
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,560
I've witnessed thousands of people do it

373
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,240
even in my close proximity so I know

374
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,680
that for me it may seem easier than for

375
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,880
you guys for some of you guys you may be

376
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,560
looking at this and going okay well it's

377
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,360
easy for you to say but trust me you'll

378
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,380
you'll understand in due time making ten

379
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,940
thousand dollars a month is the easy

380
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,620
part continuing to make ten thousand

381
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,240
dollars a month that's where it gets

382
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,980
difficult and also keeping that money

383
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,019
and then multiplying it growing your

384
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,820
wealth over time and rather than acting

385
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,620
like some new money idiots learn from

386
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,600
old money even in my situation even

387
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,160
though I am new money I knew from day

388
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,779
one that I would make it but I always

389
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,579
promised myself that I would study old

390
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:46,620
money to understand how to actually keep

391
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,000
it and multiply my wealth so the third

392
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,560
component of making ten thousand dollars

393
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,540
a month is understanding that once you

394
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,220
get there you're not done that is

395
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,200
actually simply just the beginning now

396
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,820
it is time to cement your place have

397
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,860
that as a Baseline and the crazy thing

398
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,180
is we all have Financial baselines you

399
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,860
know for me I remember when when my

400
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,360
Baseline was a thousand dollars a month

401
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,560
and this around six years ago I was

402
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,760
still in school at this point and that

403
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,019
doesn't mean what you're trying to make

404
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,940
what you're aiming to make it just means

405
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,860
if you go below that point it will keep

406
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,480
you up you're like this it doesn't match

407
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,620
your identity you're like this isn't me

408
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,060
and I remember when I went from a

409
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,500
thousand dollars and I went to five

410
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,880
thousand dollars and then went to ten

411
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,899
thousand dollars and listen since then

412
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,339
I've been very blessed to have an

413
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,600
amazing career and it's gone up to a

414
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,040
hundred thousand dollars a month and now

415
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,779
a million dollars a month and you know

416
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,040
God willing at some point it'll be a few

417
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,540
million dollars a month and that'll be

418
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,279
my absolute Baseline I can't even

419
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,839
conceive a reality where it's less than

420
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,940
that so the point I'm trying to make is

421
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,100
once you get to 10K a month it's more

422
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,420
than about making it an identity it's

423
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,740
more than about making that as your

424
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,540
Baseline as I said your financial

425
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,579
identity is not what you're aiming for

426
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,500
it's where anything below that and you

427
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:46,079
would just feel off you'll be like this

428
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,600
isn't me I'm I'm better than this so

429
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,519
number one is get to 10K a month and

430
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,560
once you get there make it your

431
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,360
financial identity and once that is

432
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,980
solid and that's locked in then you can

433
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,300
keep working your way up the ranks so

434
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,279
ladies and gentlemen I hope this has

435
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,740
been useful to you and as always I'm

436
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,980
watching you from afar and I'm rooting

437
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,980
for you
