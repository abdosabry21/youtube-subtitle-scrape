2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,799
the truth is you've been brainwashed and

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,799
this is how we got

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,960
here the system was built with the

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,760
interest of its creators in mind rather

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,240
than the interest of the students that

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,640
go through the systems themselves that's

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,000
what they were doing turning you into a

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,680
product of the system someone who gets

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,120
treated like a product that at the end

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,079
of day can be easily replaced they will

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,960
never do more than what it was

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,480
manufactured to do and that has an

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,440
expiry date and with that I don't want a

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,000
nation of thinkers I want a nation of

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,239
workers after all it was a cause for the

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,440
less favored people all in the name of

18
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:54,719
diversity and education and it worked

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,920
exactly as planned but what I found was

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:03,320
a much bigger story here it's not being

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,839
told a very carefully crafted plan a

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,520
plan that connected all of these

23
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:09,320
problems together a plan that has been

24
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,520
kept secret for a long time dating back

25
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,799
to over 250 years ago a plan that if

26
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,680
people were aware of their existence

27
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,119
would rock the foundations of the

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,159
current system and expose the side of

29
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,159
the system that is hidden in the shadows

30
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:25,159
a plan that is crafted by three

31
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,400
notorious individuals over the course of

32
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:31,840
three centuries and broken down into

33
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,840
four stages of social conditioning

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,439
the goal maximize the reach of the

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,759
system I mean kids would come in as

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,560
bright creative enthusiastic children

37
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,159
and come out as obedient mindless and

38
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,479
not capable of thinking for themselves

39
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,439
and I'm not sure if you've noticed this

40
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,240
but they purposely made the schools look

41
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,920
like prisons that's why they put the

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,320
children sitting in rows that's why they

43
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,200
had alarm Bells that's why they had

44
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,560
strict timings for classes and intervals

45
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,680
in a few short years this absolutely

46
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,880
transformed the amount of schools in the

47
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,560
United States of America and after that

48
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,480
every new generation will go to school

49
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,200
ready to learn and become critical

50
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,599
thinkers only to come out of school as

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,760
an obedient factory worker with no big

52
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,000
aspirations the system started to spread

53
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,360
itself throughout the US in record time

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,280
now listen if you're not from the US

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,840
you're probably thinking right now well

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,239
I'm not from the US so that doesn't

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,840
really affect me what does it have to do

58
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,280
with me well I'm sorry to tell you but

59
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,760
it was already growing into

60
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,959
today for every dollar the government

61
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,000
loan through student loans tuition goes

62
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,040
up by 60 on the other hand Harvard has

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,920
enough money to pay the tuition of every

64
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,920
single one of their students for the

65
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,599
next 120 years in a row this is

66
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,000
unsustainable and eventually this system

67
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:51,560
will collapse the system was built with

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,440
the interest of its creators in mind

69
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,440
rather than the interest of the students

70
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,040
that go through the systems themselves

71
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,840
and the ones above you they don't want

72
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,879
you to know about the truth they want

73
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,080
you to be a product of the system

74
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,599
someone who does what they're told and

75
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,840
nothing more and this is really how they

76
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,599
create an illusion of choice for you oh

77
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,080
you can choose this course or this

78
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:12,959
University or this degree this is how

79
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,959
they trick you on the other hand if we

80
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,400
manage to take back control over the

81
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,159
truth and get it to as many people as

82
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,360
possible we will experience the great

83
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,480
rescue where the principles that once

84
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,959
created the greatest Minds that have

85
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,239
ever stepped in this world will be

86
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,760
brought back to life and with it we'll

87
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,799
get back to the origins of

88
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,560
Education even though you've put in a

89
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,000
lot of effort into everything you've

90
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,680
been told that would make you successful

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,319
going to school getting good grades

92
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,239
getting a good degree working a safe job

93
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,560
it was all a setup from the

94
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,680
Geto it was never meant for you to

95
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,239
succeed in the way you want to but

96
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,480
rather for you to experience success in

97
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,480
their

98
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,720
terms and that's why over the last 12

99
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,519
months we've seen Mass layoffs from Big

100
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,840
corporations like Google meta Uber Etc

101
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,599
the bubble is not about to burst it

102
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,840
already started

103
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,519
bursting the problem is somewhere along

104
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,600
the journey there was a shift in powers

105
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,919
and the ones who got to power they

106
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,600
stopped caring about the interest of

107
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,639
their people and here's the thing the

108
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,440
ideals and principles that education was

109
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,880
originally built upon they were the

110
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,040
ideals that created some of the most

111
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,160
brilliant individuals and brightest

112
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,600
Minds the world has ever seen

113
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,120
they were fighting the same war and

114
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,800
followed the book on how to win it so

115
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:47,660
