love all the trainers and stuff like

39
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,500
that but the 247 is like where it's at

40
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,060
for me because I just love the

41
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Simplicity of it I know a lot of other

42
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,020
people want to wear stuff that's just

43
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,000
very minimal if if not if even no

44
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,680
branding the stuff that fits nice yeah

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,660
it's funny because like what sells

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,160
really well in 247 is the Big Brand and

47
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,260
stuff yeah which is kind of like

48
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,819
annoying but it is what it is pants are

49
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,500

is that really all the stuff yeah yeah

54
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,440
like the stuff that sells is like the

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,519
big logo heavy stuff because people want

56
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,060
to feel like they're part of the club

57
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,060
yeah

58
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,879

68
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,239
and culture like bro we have an

69
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,400
incredible culture like even just one of

70
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,019
our companies got all 75 of that company

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,220

if you want to do it and every single

73
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,980
person raise their hand but also we

74
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,980
don't hire fat people that's a rule

75
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,120
I should he's like I should have invited

76
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,560
him you can hire fat people but it's

77
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,780
your obligation to change them that's

78
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,580
exactly number 100 no we have people who

79
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,140
are not in the best shape yeah but they

80
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,760
can suddenly change them by making them

81
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,959
fit that will change their lives change

82
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,760
their work that'll change their family

83
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,019
that'll change everything maybe it'll

84
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,580
end up meaning they'll leave their

85
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,379
family or whatever yeah but it's a

86
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,440
[ __ ] good thing it's bad for them not

87
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:49,260
100 so the workout is 3K role to start

88
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,019
with and 100 push press then eight to

89
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:55,440
hand cleans then after that it's six to

90
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:57,000
HD sit-ups 40 deadlifts and then 20

91
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,180
double press and then we're going back

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,220
up yeah uh everything's split evenly

93
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,220
sort of impairs but everything's close

94
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,800
and just watch how to flick the bars up

95
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,660
and like keep the bars as close as they

96
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,759
can to them yeah it makes it so much

97
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,320
easier but the thing is even in the

98
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,940
middle of winter I'll wake up at the

99
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,160
same time and nothing nothing changes

100
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,020
