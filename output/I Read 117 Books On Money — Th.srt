1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
I have read hundreds of books on

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,359
everything from investing to corporate

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,260
structure to the psychology of

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,139
persuasion and here's the truth 95 of

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,440
what they tell you is completely useless

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,180
when it comes to actually getting rich

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,580
so let me go ahead and save you the

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,460
thousands of hours I have spent reading

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,680
that never actually benefited me when it

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,900
comes to making money now listen do not

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,000
get me wrong the books I read were

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,399
wonderful in their own right they were

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,420
fascinating but they didn't help me get

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,820
rich and honestly you have no time to

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,820
waste so these are the 17 books that

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,140
will actually make you rich the first

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,180
thing that you really need to understand

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,520
is that the type of books you're gonna

19
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,500
read to go from zero to ten thousand

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,120
dollars a month will be very different

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,500
to those that you're going to read in

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,960
order to hit a hundred thousand dollar

23
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,640
months or even make a million dollars a

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,340
month so therefore I actually divided

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,440
these 17 books into three categories

26
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,000
going from zero to ten thousand dollars

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,739
a month ten thousand to a hundred

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,720
thousand dollars a month and a hundred

29
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,180
thousand dollars to a million dollars a

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,920
month then I actually threw in a bonus

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,720
category which is the books that will

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,180
help you grow from a million dollars a

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,760
month to ten million dollars a month and

34
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,560
Beyond and honestly I would say that

35
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,740
that is probably the most interesting

36
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,080
one and that's because at that level

37
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,880
macro economics actually become the most

38
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,740
important thing that's really when you

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,900
start to study how the world actually

40
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,759
works you get into books like the house

41
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,100
of Morgan which explains the truth

42
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,659
behind the banking system but we're

43
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,560
gonna get to that a little later in the

44
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,820
video now the first book on this list

45
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,920
almost sets the foundation for

46
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,159
everything to come and by the way it's

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,439
also the only fictional work on this

48
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,960
list and I'm talking about The Alchemist

49
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,119
now this book tackles the very

50
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,399
prerequisite of making money and getting

51
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,040
rich and that's having the guts to

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,420
actually follow your purpose because

53
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,700
make no stake about it is far easier to

54
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,740
never take that leap of faith or to

55
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,800
never start that business so before you

56
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,780
can even think about making money you

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,640
need to have a very honest conversation

58
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,900
with yourself and you need to decide if

59
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,700
you're willing to take that bet on

60
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,160
yourself and decide if you are willing

61
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,260
to overcome the obstacles that come with

62
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,120
following your purpose because when

63
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,620
you're starting from zero and you want

64
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,840
to get to ten thousand dollars per month

65
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,480
that is probably the hardest income

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,580
threshold to reach and the reason behind

67
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,040
that is because everything is working

68
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,379
against you you see when you're first

69
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,900
starting out you actually need to rewire

70
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:42,060
your entire brain you don't need to

71
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,000
Simply make money but you need to become

72
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,280
the person that's worthy of making money

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,860
so when I say that everything is working

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,980
against you what I mean by that is that

75
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,140
the person you once were is at odds with

76
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,379
the person that you're becoming and just

77
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:01,800
like Newton's first law of motion you're

78
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:03,660
fighting inertia and in some sense zero

79
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,959
to ten thousand dollars a month boils

80
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,480
down to one thing mindset you need to

81
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,099
adopt that mindset that success is not

82
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,980
just a desire

83
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,959
it's a necessity and that is exactly the

84
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:19,440
lesson of the next book on the list

85
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,300
Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill and

86
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,519
much like the title of the book suggests

87
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,760
it boils down to the idea that if you're

88
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,659
able to conceive it and leave it well

89
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,459
then

90
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:31,200
you can achieve it and I'd say that's

91
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,900
really the first step towards becoming

92
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,180
rich actually believing that you can and

93
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,159
realizing that it's the only path

94
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,440
forward you see the book also talks

95
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,019
about another Pitfall I see far too

96
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,459
often in people just getting started you

97
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,280
see often when you're getting started

98
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,680
you'll get stuck waiting waiting for the

99
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,780
perfect moment waiting for the perfect

100
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,299
business model just waiting for

101
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,000
everything in order to not get started

102
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,340
and the truth is as obvious as it seems

103
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,099
is that there's no perfect time there

104
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,900
never was and there never will be in the

105
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,120
beginning of any Journey let alone the

106
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,000
Journey of getting rich is going to be

107
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,760
messy and my friend that's simply the

108
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,280
name of the game and honestly being able

109
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,320
to navigate through that mess is what

110
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,180
will make you successful and here's

111
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,100
where we get to the next book Atomic

112
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,919
habits you see the next book Atomic

113
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,380
Habits by James Clear teaches you how to

114
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,600
do exactly that you see we already

115
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,780
established that you need to become a

116
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,360
person worthy of success so how do you

117
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,699
do that well you are the sum of all of

118
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,259
your actions so to change yourself you

119
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,820
need to change your actions and

120
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:40,860
obviously you can't just reinvent

121
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,620
yourself overnight so you need to do it

122
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,979
in incremental steps by implementing new

123
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,259
habits killing old ones and keeping the

124
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:51,600
worthy ones and that's exactly what

125
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,800
Atomic habits teaches you to do I

126
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,900
remember when I read it for the first

127
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,940
time it completely changed how I

128
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,940
approached my work and allowed me to

129
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,340
stack all of my good habits day by day I

130
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,680
kept solidifying my habits until they

131
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,240
eventually became second nature now real

132
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,500
quick before I get to the next book I

133
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,020
know a lot of you guys are watching this

134
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,880
and going this is amazing but none of

135
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,460
these books are going to show me what

136
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,040
online business do I start this year

137
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,139
that will actually get me Rich because

138
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,600
as I said these are 17 of my favorite

139
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,860
books out of hundreds that I've read but

140
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,020
these books aren't going to tell you hey

141
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,400
this year this model is working this

142
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,539
model is not working maybe you should

143
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,400
try this based on your personal

144
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,900
personality type so that's why I'm going

145
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,840
to leave the link to my most popular

146
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,940

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,039

business model is the right one for them

149
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:43,080

151
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,620
you finish that video I will leave a

152
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,300
link in the description go ahead check

153
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,160
out that YouTube video pick the right

154
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,780
business model for you and let's get

155
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,820
back to the video now once you've built

156
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,259
a solid base of habits and perhaps

157
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,120
you've already chosen your business

158
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:59,280
model and you're starting to make some

159
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,979
cash you need to start setting

160
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,740
expectations and what I mean by this is

161
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:06,479
you need to really begin to understand

162
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,160
how to think about money and that is

163
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,620
exactly what you're going to learn in

164
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,060
money Master the game by Tony Robbins

165
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,520
you know it's funny I distinctly

166
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,440
remember being 17 years old reading this

167
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,840
book and doing one of the exercises

168
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,699
where you have to design your life in

169
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,740
three ways in the first scenario you're

170
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,780
just scraping by and you write down how

171
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,340
much money you need in order to make

172
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,259
that happen from your passive

173
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,000
investments in the second scenario

174
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,860
you're living comfortable but not

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,440
extravagantly and once again you need to

176
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,600
calculate how much of a nest egg you

177
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,060
need in order for that to happen and in

178
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,639
the final scenario you calculate how

179
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,319
much money you need to go all out and

180
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,539
what you'll come to realize is that if

181
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,580
you're being honest with yourself

182
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:49,500
success is a lot closer than you may

183
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,199
think and it's funny I even went through

184
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,180
this exercise as a 17 year old and I'm

185
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,039
sure we all think we're like oh I need

186
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,840
to make a 10 million dollars a year to

187
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,520
live my dream lifestyle and I looked at

188
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,560
it and after I had written everything

189
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,699
down my dream lifestyle was like seventy

190
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,800
thousand dollars a month and the funny

191
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,080
thing is the next year when I was 18

192
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,240
years old I was making that amount of

193
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,100
money every single month so I guess it's

194
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,380
just crazy how writing things down

195
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,240
physically works and it's funny I still

196
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,160
have those journals in my house to this

197
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,600
day but anyways back to my point I think

198
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,759
for me it was very powerful because in

199
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,860
my mind as I said I thought like from my

200
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,060
dream lifestyle I have to make millions

201
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,800
and millions of dollars a year and

202
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,419
listen seventy thousand dollars a month

203
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,759
I understand it's still a good chunk of

204
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:31,319
of money it was still substantially less

205
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,120
than what I thought I did so when I

206
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,740
wrote everything down I was like oh wow

207
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,900
for me to live my dream lifestyle it's a

208
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,400
lot closer than I thought now listen of

209
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,500
course your expectations will always

210
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,479
change and as you become more successful

211
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,280
you might want more from life but it's

212
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,500
just a very powerful exercise to get you

213
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,660
to quantify what success actually looks

214
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,340
like financially because how can you

215
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,199
start working towards success if you

216
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,419
don't even know what it means when it

217
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,639
comes to cents or dollars so once you've

218
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:59,099
set your expectations you need to start

219
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,080
executing and executing by the way means

220
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:03,120
how do I make that money actively you

221
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,099
know in the same way that a year later I

222
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,840
was actively earning what was my dream

223
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:08,940
lifestyle you know my future dream

224
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,560
lifestyle I had written 18 months before

225
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,120
or you know a year before and what's

226
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,039
even more powerful is that if your

227
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,259
passive income gets to a point where

228
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:17,400
where it pays for that lifestyle for the

229
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,900
rest of your life and what I mean by

230
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,699
passive I mean the income from your

231
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,199
Investments not some business that is

232
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,479
passive because these things can always

233
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,220
shrink and you know and businesses get

234
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,319
stale and I'm talking about your safe

235
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,639
Investments to grow your one year and

236
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,039
what was crazy for me was that three

237
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,140
years later after I had done that from

238
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,539
an active perspective I'd built up a big

239
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,459
enough Nest Egg where I made that every

240
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,200
single year just from my investments so

241
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:42,599
that's really all to say that this stuff

242
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,740
is powerful and the stuff works now the

243
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,720
next set of books I want to talk about

244
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,980
is going from ten to a hundred thousand

245
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,959
dollars a month because once you've

246
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,180
nailed down your mindset and your work

247
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,700
machine you really enter the next phase

248
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,980
of getting rich now instead of working

249
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,980
harder you need to learn how to work

250
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,360
smarter or preferably still do both but

251
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,760
that really means that you need to focus

252
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,740
on systems that you can leverage and as

253
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,480
a result the type of books that will get

254
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,040
you from ten to a hundred thousand

255
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,860
dollars a month are very very different

256
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,800
in the four hour work week illustrates

257
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,839
this point perfectly in describing the

258
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,000
Pareto Principle you see the Pareto

259
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,580
Principle also known as the 80 20 rule

260
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,180
states that 80 percent of Any Given

261
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,519
output derives from 20 of the input so

262
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,680
in other words twenty percent of your

263
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,720
clients will make up eighty percent of

264
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,480
your revenue and the craziest part is

265
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,580
that this rule extends far beyond just

266
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,000
business it's pretty much a law of

267
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:41,220
nature for example 20 of food causes 80

268
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,500
of weight gain so regardless of how you

269
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,899
frame it the 80 20 rule allows you to

270
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,820
figure out how to work smarter not

271
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,399
harder the next book we need to talk

272
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,019
about is influence and the psychology of

273
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,660
persuasion now this is one of the

274
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:57,660
highest leveraged skills you can have is

275
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:00,060
the ability to persuade masses of people

276
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,940
and that's really where influence the

277
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,920
psychology of persuasion this book truly

278
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,540
shines and I feel like this book is very

279
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,399
powerful when you read it right before

280
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,680
reading the next one which is

281
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,899
confessions of an advertising man you

282
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,180
see this book paired with David ogilvy's

283
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:17,100
confessions of an advertising man are

284
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,440
pretty much the only marketing books

285
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,940
that you will ever need to get rich

286
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,980
because they're going to teach you the

287
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,680
fundamentals of persuasion both in

288
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,899
marketing and more broadly as well as

289
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,300
the skill of copywriting so once you

290
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:32,040
know how to Market and persuade buyers

291
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,399
you need to make sure that your product

292
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,380
is constantly evolving and that is the

293
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,300
focal point of the next book I'm going

294
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,339
to recommend which is the Lean Startup

295
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,220
now the book talks about the importance

296
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,200
of execution plus having a proper

297
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,720
feedback loop because when you're able

298
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,760
to execute fast and have proper feedback

299
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,339
you're going to be able to quickly pivot

300
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,980
off the back of that and tap into the

301
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,839
heart of the demand in any given market

302
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,000
now the next high leverage skill you

303
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,800
need in Your Arsenal as you build your

304
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,320
way up from ten to a hundred thousand

305
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,519
dollars per month is negotiation and

306
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,500
we've all heard the saying that

307
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,260
everything is a negotiation and that's

308
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,640
precisely why it's so important to be

309
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,860
good at it now the difference between

310
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,620
knowing nothing and just reading a few

311
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,760
books on the topic are massive and

312
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,260
that's why I never split the difference

313
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,120
is going to give you the Baseline you

314
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,339
need in your path to a hundred thousand

315
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,740
dollars a month it teaches you a method

316
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:28,620
called tactical empathy which you can

317
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,600
use to build trust and Rapport and the

318
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,720
result of this the other person will

319
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,760
mimic the same level of empathy for you

320
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,640
whether you're negotiating with clients

321
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,740
business partners or potential investors

322
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,660
the techniques in this book will help

323
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,399
you make more money and it doesn't have

324
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,260
to be Complicated by the way simple

325
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,180
things like mirroring what the person is

326
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,279
doing in front of you will have a

327
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,260
profound subconscious effect on them

328
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:54,360
that could mean just repeating someone's

329
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,399
last few words at the beginning of your

330
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,740
sentence that can form the familiarity

331
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,779
that you need to win negotiations but

332
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,339
the key to success here is understanding

333
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:05,100
people and that's where the next book

334
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,779
comes in now listen no matter where you

335
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,519
make your money you're gonna have to

336
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:11,279
deal with people it doesn't matter if

337
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,140
it's your employees or the police you

338
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,880
need to know how to deal with people

339
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,519
because the difference between knowing

340
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,860
how to navigate the social landscape and

341
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,320
not is truly the difference between

342
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:25,200
failure and success you need to learn

343
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,959
how to inspire others to fulfill your

344
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,459
vision and also how to not piss off the

345
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,680
wrong people because let me tell you

346
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:34,560
something friends are far more useful

347
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,540
than enemies and that's why how to Win

348
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,660
Friends and Influence People is perhaps

349
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:42,899
the best book I've read when it comes to

350
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:45,540
understanding human nature that book

351
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:47,940
when the 48 Laws of Power are your

352
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,760
complete guide to Human Relationships

353
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:53,100
the 48 Laws of Power teaches you laws of

354
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,079
human nature it's actually rooted in

355
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,600
history now I also want to give you a

356
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:01,079
disclaimer and say that the 48 Laws of

357
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,540
Power can also be used for evil so make

358
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:05,579
sure you use it wisely now once you've

359
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,339
nailed down your marketing your product

360
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:10,800
and your relationships there's one

361
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:13,079
Central Point that remains you need to

362
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,360
be able to build a bulletproof business

363
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:18,660
and that means you need to understand

364
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,800
the ins and outs of business so when

365
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,720
you're trying to get from ten thousand

366
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,639
dollars per month you can be a bit rough

367
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,560
around the edges but that does not fly

368
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,300
when you want to play in the big leagues

369
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,760
now sure you could go out and spend a

370
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,100
quarter million dollars on an MBA or you

371
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,320
could just read the personal MBA because

372
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,800
this book distills everything you need

373
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,899
to know about business and really 99 of

374
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,060
the things you'd learn from doing an MBA

375
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:44,300
in the first place this book talks about

376
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:47,579
everything from operations management

377
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:49,320
and finance to leadership and accounting

378
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:51,660
and I can promise you that if you read

379
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,880
just this book you'll know more than

380
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,200
most business owners now next let's talk

381
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,700
about going from a hundred thousand

382
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,200
dollars a month to a million dollars a

383
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,360
month now something interesting happens

384
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,339
when you go from 100K to a million

385
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,620
dollars a month you see up until 100K

386
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:07,139
per month you focus on building skills

387
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,660
you want to learn the nitty-gritty that

388
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,459
allows you to excel essentially there's

389
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,220
a one-to-one relationship between your

390
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:16,320
skills and your income but that changes

391
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,480
drastically when you want to get 10

392
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,700
million dollars per month now the

393
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,040
knowledge you begin to seek is far more

394
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,320
esoteric instead of looking to improve

395
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,079
your sales you're trying to understand

396
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,360
the bigger picture that you operate in

397
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,160
in simply where you start to look beyond

398
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,079
your business and that's when things get

399
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,760
really exciting and at a hundred

400
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,639
thousand dollars a month is also when

401
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:41,220
investing becomes crucial in your wealth

402
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,680
accumulation now of course you should

403
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,540
have good investing habits from day one

404
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,760
but at a hundred thousand dollars a

405
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,920
month and above is where things get

406
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,079
serious and that is precisely why you

407
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,480
need to read books like the intelligent

408
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,940
investor to really move the needle when

409
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,320
it comes to making you more money and

410
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,139
this is not just some get rich quick

411
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,019
scheme this is a tried and tested method

412
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:06,420
since 1949. the book outlines everything

413
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:08,160
you need to know about value investing

414
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,980
which is really the only way you should

415
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,860
be investing to protect and multiply

416
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,060
your wealth with minimal risk now later

417
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,220
in the video we're going to talk a

418
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,800
little bit about JP Morgan but there's

419
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,680
one quote in particular that stands out

420
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,779
from him you see JP Morgan famously once

421
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,959
said that whilst millionaires don't use

422
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:30,540
astrology billionaires do in the next

423
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:33,360
book reality Tran surfing is less about

424
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:36,180
astrology but it is about using the

425
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,639
world to your advantage reality Tran

426
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:41,639
surfing posts a theory that you can

427
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,760
manage your reality with Tran surfing

428
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,800
you can make your goal rules happen now

429
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,079
of course take this with a grain of salt

430
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,720
but there is no doubt that there is much

431
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:53,519
more to reality than meets the eye and

432
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,579
equally it is clear that some people

433
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,680
just seem to be able to bend reality to

434
00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:00,180
their will and all I'm gonna say to that

435
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,980
point is that I know a lot of people

436
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,500
look at me

437
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,240
with that same thought they look at me

438
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,980
and they go how have you done all of

439
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,860
this how have you accomplished all this

440
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,740
how have you been able to bend reality

441
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,360
to exactly what you wanted and all I'm

442
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,279
going to say to that is I read reality

443
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,260
Tran surfing when I was 14 years old for

444
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,480
the first time since then I must have

445
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,279
reread it over a dozen times I'm not

446
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,579
going to say anything more make of that

447
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,920
who you will now as important as it is

448
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:31,320
to master your own reality you also need

449
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,019
to understand everyone else's because

450
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,459
how people act ultimately shapes the

451
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,620
economy and that's what the book

452
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:40,019
misbehaving is all about it's an

453
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,000
introduction to behavioral economics

454
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:43,920
behavioral economics is one of those

455
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,360
areas that simply doesn't matter when

456
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,519
you just want to get to ten thousand

457
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,079
dollars a month but it matters a whole

458
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,699
lot when you want to get to a hundred

459
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:52,740
thousand dollars and especially a

460
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:54,240
million dollars a month or more the book

461
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,699
explains how investors can use

462
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,160
behavioral economics to their advantage

463
00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:02,940
and this is yet another great example of

464
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,500
how one simple book can make you now

465
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,360
let's go from a million dollars a month

466
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,100
to 10 million dollars a month and

467
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,500
further and this is where things get

468
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:13,380
very very interesting here's where

469
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,600
things begin to really shift to get to a

470
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,579
million dollars a month and above you

471
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,679
need to analyze the world around you and

472
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,600
you need to understand how things work

473
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,520
but in order to get to 10 million

474
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,220
dollars a month onwards you need to

475
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,500
start analyzing history in order to

476
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,140
understand the future and it's at this

477
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,820
level you need to get into the most

478
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,919
esoteric books books that I've been

479
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,500
talking about for years on my YouTube

480
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:40,799
books like the creature of Jekyll Island

481
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:43,380
this book unveils The Secrets of the

482
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,000
money magicians of the Federal Reserve

483
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,820
because it's only once you begin to

484
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,760
understand how money actually works that

485
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,380
you can start to really get wealthy and

486
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,179
I know that when I read this book it

487
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,820
completely opened my eyes to the real

488
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:58,919
world a world which most people are

489
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,840
blind to but once you understand the

490
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:02,940
Federal Reserve you also need to

491
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,160
understand how the banking system works

492
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,559
and once you understand the fed and the

493
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,480
banking system you can truly begin to

494
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,820
realize your ultimate potential and

495
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,039
that's why these books are so important

496
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,360
in making you rich and that's why the

497
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:17,580
next book I want to talk about which is

498
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,440
the house of Morgan it's actually a

499
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,299
biography of the entire Morgan family

500
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,640
and how they created the modern day

501
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:26,280
banking system I have said this time and

502
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:29,280
time again but history is doomed to

503
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:32,280
repeat itself and the only way to truly

504
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,620
be able to understand the future is by

505
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:37,020
studying the past and once you have a

506
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:39,240
firm grasp on the past you can even

507
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:41,640
begin to start predicting the future you

508
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,620
see history repeats itself and you can

509
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,940
actually use that to your advantage go

510
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,220
ahead and think about all the different

511
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,520
bubbles in history everything from the

512
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:53,039
gold rush in the 1850s to the rise of

513
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:56,160
Bitcoin I mean what if you'd bought

514
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:58,020
Bitcoin in 2010 well if these cycles of

515
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,059
boom and bust have happened all

516
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,860
throughout history well then they're

517
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:03,780
bound to happen again the key is that

518
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,360
you need to be able to spot the trend

519
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:09,059
before everyone else and that is exactly

520
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:11,039
what devil take the hindmost teaches you

521
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:14,580
this book will walk you through the

522
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,200
major cycles of boom and bust in recent

523
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,520
history and that means that after

524
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,340
reading this you're going to be able to

525
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,440
identify these Trends and that my friend

526
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:25,260
is how you can multiply your wealth

527
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,059
tenfold equally it's also how you can

528
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:30,179
protect your wealth so that's why it's

529
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:33,299
so important to understand the past in

530
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:35,460
order to understand or even predict the

531
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:37,860
future you see in some sense getting

532
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:41,220
rich is all about doing the right thing

533
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,480
in the right order at the right time I

534
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,580
mean just think about it you could have

535
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,100
had the best idea for a tech startup

536
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,980
after the.com bubble but you would have

537
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,360
never gotten funding and vice versa so

538
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,059
that's why it's important to be able to

539
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,620
spot the trends as they emerge so ladies

540
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,059
and gentlemen those are the 17 books

541
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,860
that will help you make your first ten

542
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:00,900
thousand dollar a month all the way up

543
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,880
to your first 10 million dollar a month

544
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,620
those are the best books I I have used

545
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,720
in that time period if you want to make

546
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,679
more than 10 million dollars a month I

547
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,380
can't help you with that because I've

548
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,900
never done that but these books read at

549
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,640
the right time in that order have helped

550
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,200
me the most and I can tell you the books

551
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,820
that I read to start making more than a

552
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,020
million dollars a month I still read

553
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,940
some of those books when I was dead

554
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,679
broke it was interesting but I don't

555
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,600
feel like it helped me at the right time

556
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,460
and that's why I think it's so important

557
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,500
that you read these books I mean you can

558
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,120
read them for entertainment even if they

559
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,039
don't apply to your current situation

560
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,020
but just understand when you read these

561
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:35,820
books at the right time when you're

562
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,559
facing the problems that these books

563
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,360
will teach you about that's when it's

564
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,340
the most powerful a lot of these books I

565
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,320
reread when I applied more to me and my

566
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,120
life situation at that period of time

567
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,140
and it was always so mind-blowing

568
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,059
because I would read the book and I'm

569
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,100
like but I've read this before but why

570
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:52,440
is it that this time I find it so

571
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,299
incredible like why has this been so

572
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,000
powerful this time and of course it was

573
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:59,460
because it directly reflected what I was

574
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,919
going through at that point in my wealth

575
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,840
creation phase so ladies and gentlemen I

576
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,000
really hope enjoyed this video I stayed

577
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,860
at a very very late compiling all these

578
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,780
books and just going through all of my

579
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,480
physical books all of my Kindle books

580
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:14,700
everything to really bring you this

581
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,700
specific list so I hope it was a value

582
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:22,039
to you and as always I'll be watching

583
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,039
you from afar and I'm rooting for you
