1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
you are young I'm 17 years old you're

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,379
ambitious I worked my face off and you

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,880
want to make it big early in your life

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,519
so in today's video I'm going to reveal

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,679
the seven principles for teenagers and

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,780
people in their early 20s to become

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,400
millionaires now I made my first million

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,199
dollars at 18 years old and no matter

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,240
what you see on Tick Tock I want you to

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,699
know that that is not normal it is not

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,439
normal in any shape form or fashion but

12
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,119
it is because I followed these seven

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,920
principles so what I'm going to reveal

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,720
to you today not only helped me make my

15
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,880
first million dollars at 18 years old it

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,460
has helped me to amass a net worth of

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,680
tens of millions of dollars by the age

18
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,140
of 23. so I'm speaking from experience

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,180
here but I do want to make it clear that

20
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,980
no matter what anyone says I will hold

21
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,600
my hand up and say that a very large

22
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,180
portion of why I'm in the position I am

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,340
today is because of luck or the grace of

24
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,960
God in my opinion and timing so just

25
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,520
factor that in now real quick before we

26
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,440
get into today's video I've had tons of

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,600
people over the years ask me to do like

28
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,399
q and A's on Instagram or even here on

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,680
YouTube where I answer questions to

30
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,420
people's specific cases you know their

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,400
particular question and I'll be honest

32
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,680
my main Instagram is just a stupid place

33
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,780
where I post photo dumps from trips

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,280
business trips what's going on in my

35
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,780
life stuff like that but earlier this

36
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,119
year I created an Instagram account

37
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,860
called at talk with Eman so you can just

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,600
pull up your phone and request to follow

39
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,040
that account I usually tell my team to

40
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,320

business advice but apart from that

48
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,759
let's get back into the video the first

49
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,460
principle you need to learn if you want

50
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,740
to be a millionaire in your teens or

51
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,040
your early 20s is that in order to be a

52
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,079
king you must first be a pawn and this

53
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,000
is really the issue with this generation

54
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,740
and I say this generation even though I

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,299
am included in it but I grew up with

56
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,460
very traditional principles around

57
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,380
respect I come from a background that is

58
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,420
a mix between Eastern European and

59
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,460
Middle Eastern so like growing up you

60
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,439
have no option you learn respect and you

61
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,299
learn the pecking order and I learned

62
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,860
from a young age that you respect your

63
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,540
elders and that's why still to the state

64
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,860
I still sit across the table from people

65
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,259
that I'm gonna be very honest with you

66
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,580
are far less successful than I am but I

67
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,319
shut the up and I listen because

68
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,520
for me in my culture you listen to your

69
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,020
elders now that doesn't mean you need to

70
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,760
take everything that they say on board

71
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,680
but you at least listen and because I

72
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,840
grew up in this environment of learning

73
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,400
respect I learned that hey you can be a

74
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,260
king one day but in order to be a king

75
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,599
you first need to be a pawn you first

76
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,160
need to be able to earn your stripes and

77
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,840
by the way I earned my stripes from a

78
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,000
very young age I started my first

79
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,800
entrepreneurial Ventures when I was 14

80
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,780
and I learned what it was like to work

81
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,280
with clients and quite frankly for a

82
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,260
lack of a better word be their little

83
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,420
 boy I learned what it was like to

84
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,680
pay my dues no matter what it's kind of

85
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,060
like listen when you're young and you

86
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,620
join a football team you're going to be

87
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,879
the one who's the ball boy at the end of

88
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,500
training you're going to be the one who

89
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,540
is expected to carry all of the

90
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,400
equipment to and from and you need to go

91
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,660
through that to one day become the

92
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,459
captain you don't just come in

93
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,019
especially as someone who is Young and

94
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,580
become the captain all of a sudden and

95
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,920
that is the issue with today's social

96
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,540
media Society they look at

97
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,400
things and they look at people and they

98
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,379
go okay I'm going to jump from here to

99
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,879
here and I deserve that for some reason

100
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,440
and I even get this to this day people

101
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,720
say hey man why do you recommend

102
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,800
business models that you used to do why

103
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,260
don't you recommend what you're doing

104
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,599
right now do you realize how stupid that

105
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,640
sounds do you realize why I may suggest

106
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,319
business models I did when I first

107
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,580
started my entrepreneurial Ventures or

108
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,680
within three years into my

109
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,200
entrepreneurial Ventures not now that I

110
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,480
am coming up to my 10th year as an

111
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,400
entrepreneur do you not realize why I

112
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,860
would suggest businesses that I started

113
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,500
as a pawn as someone with no resources

114
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,120
no connection no money nothing do you

115
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,739
realize why I suggest those businesses

116
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,140
rather than the businesses I have now

117
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,760
with millions of followers subscribers

118
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,080
tens of millions of dollars like I'm

119
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,640
sure you can kind of see why I think

120
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,780
this is better than this but this is

121
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,400
what I'm saying the younger generation

122
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,019
they look at things and they're like no

123
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,060
I want to jump straight to the Finish

124
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,879
Line you have to earn your

125
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,640
Stripes so just remember to be a king

126
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,920
you must first learn to be a pawn and

127
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,900
there is an nothing wrong with that by

128
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,819
the way there is honor there is no

129
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,400
ability in starting from the bottom of

130
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:10,439
the pecking order being quiet respecting

131
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,299
the process and understanding that you

132
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,099
will eventually work your way up the

133
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,840
totem pole now the next principle for

134
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,699
teenagers to become millionaires is

135
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,199
dressed to elevate and here's what I

136
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,180
mean by that when you are young people

137
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,680
are going to automatically discredit you

138
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,419
you don't want to make it worse by the

139
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,280
way that you dress so here's the thing

140
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:29,460
you can have a 30 year old that dresses

141
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,320
in big labels Gucci Balenciaga where's

142
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,000
the funny shoes and all that stuff and

143
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,220
listen I mean I'm not against it

144
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,960
sometimes when I'm feeling comfortable I

145
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,580
dress in streetwear but if I'm going to

146
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,020
an important meeting I can guarantee you

147
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,759
I'm not dressed like that and my point

148
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,680
is that you can get a 30 year old that

149
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,660
dresses like that that looks like a 20

150
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,759
year old whereas you can get a 18 or 20

151
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,979
year old that dresses very traditional

152
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,199
very classic and you can get an 18 or 20

153
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:54,660
year old that looks like they're 30. so

154
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,699
the point is don't spend crazy amounts

155
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,960
of money to have all these labels and

156
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:59,759
this and that and I don't think that's a

157
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,620
good idea ever unless you really can

158
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,880
afford ordered you have a full wardrobe

159
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,860
and sometimes you just want to be a

160
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,960
little playful my best recommendation is

161
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,940
just go for clothes that have no

162
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,259
branding No Label and I'm not saying

163
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,300
that you need to dress in three-piece

164
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,880
suits listen even if you just go in a

165
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,860
simple black T-shirt simple trousers

166
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,660
that aren't too baggy and definitely no

167
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,060
skinny jeans and just some classic

168
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,919
Timeless shape shoes listen you're not

169
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,780
dressing incredibly well but the point

170
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,240
is you can kind of hold your own in any

171
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,400
room sometimes less really is more so

172
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,259
first learn how to just dress classic

173
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,180
and Timeless and then later down the

174
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,740
line you can start incorporating some

175
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,360
suits you can start incorporating some

176
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,740
double-breasted suits maybe before you

177
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,780
go to the suits just get some nice

178
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,340
Blazers and you compare the Blazers with

179
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,780
trousers it doesn't need to be a full

180
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,400
suit you know a lot of times I'm just

181
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,320
very comfortable with a nice round neck

182
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,060
t-shirt not like this this is a lot more

183
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,680
you know it's a Sunday today a very home

184
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,780
comfortable shirt so not something as

185
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,120
casual as this just a nice fitted white

186
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,100
T-shirt or black T-shirt and smart

187
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,660
Blazer over the top some trousers and

188
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,580
some smart shoes and you have a very

189
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,740
classic Timeless look that's not overly

190
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,660
formal and you're never going to be too

191
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,919
overdressed in any situation and then as

192
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,360
I said later down the line you can get

193
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,100
into your double-breasted so you can get

194
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,660
into your three pieces whatever you feel

195
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,340
comfortable in really but the point is

196
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,440
that you really need to learn how to

197
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,820
dress to elevate especially if you're

198
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,560
going into the world of business at a

199
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,600
young age because I'm being honest with

200
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,000
you I experience this firsthand people

201
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,860
will try to discredit you because of

202
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,600
your age so don't give them any excuse

203
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,759
or Reason to make it an even bigger

204
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,620
thing than it needs to be so dress older

205
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,840
than you are now the third principle for

206
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,180
teenagers to become millionaires is have

207
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,680
something external that humbles you and

208
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,360
here's what I mean by that there's a lot

209
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,100
of people who are young with a lot of

210
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,080
ambition in their life but the issue is

211
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,819
there's nothing in their life that has

212
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,979
humbled them things that will humble you

213
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,360
Combat Sports business will humble you

214
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,860
because no matter how good you are when

215
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,240
you get in the world of business the

216
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,620
market will tell you how good you are

217
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,120
I'll give you a perfect example I

218
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,060
remember when I was 17 years old I had

219
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,680
gone up to I think 15 or 20 grand in my

220
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,139
business at that point I dropped out of

221
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,780
school the month prior and I hired my

222
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,919
first employee full-time employee fifty

223
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,680
thousand dollars a year which by the way

224
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,479
for a first employee was like at 17 that

225
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,759
was big for me and I'll never forget it

226
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,100
this person even moved country to join

227
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,259
my company AKA just me and within three

228
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,759
to four days he quit packed up his stuff

229
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,800
and went back to his country and was

230
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,060
like I do not enjoy this work and I

231
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,620
remember it was one of the very few

232
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,240
times I've ever cried in my life I

233
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,699
remember talking to my mom and just

234
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,259
crying and just being like wow I feel

235
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,699
like a failure your business is taking

236
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:28,979
off and you're hiring your first

237
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,599
employee and they leave because a the

238
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:32,160
work isn't enjoyable enough or

239
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,840
potentially and this is something I had

240
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,699
to face at the time maybe I just really

241
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,500
wasn't an inspiring leader maybe I

242
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:39,780
wasn't a sort of leader where my team

243
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,039
was like I would follow you into war and

244
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,800
things are very different now that I

245
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,419
have 150 employees we get 40 000 people

246
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,240
a year applying to work at one of my

247
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:50,520
companies because I was humbled when I

248
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,840
was 17 that hey maybe you're not as good

249
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,639
as you think you are maybe you think

250
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,560
that you're this little child prodigy

251
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,240
are you sure about that let me humble

252
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,039
you so whether it's business whether

253
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,680
it's Combat Sports you need something

254
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,060
external in your life to Humble you and

255
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,319
put you in your place because the thing

256
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,639
is especially if you earn a lot of

257
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,560
success at a young age you're gonna

258
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,060
start to think you're hot and if

259
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,039
you don't have anything to Humble you

260
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,080
you will end up becoming your worst

261
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,960
enemy the next principle you need to

262
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,880
follow is no casual dating either

263
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,740
something serious or nothing at all

264
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,080
listen if you are in your teenage years

265
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,599
or your early 20s either you go for

266
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,580
something serious no casual dates no

267
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:29,460
casual flings stuff like that listen you

268
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,560
are a man in your early years make

269
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,300
something of yourself and either have a

270
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,399
partner early on they will support you

271
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,979
through that as something serious or

272
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,260
none of this casual hinge Tinder blah

273
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,060
blah all this none of this casual dating

274
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,919
because let me tell you something it is

275
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,899
taking you away from your best years

276
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,240
your best years to build and the other

277
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,560
thing is we live in a very brutal dating

278
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,220
culture I'm gonna be very honest with

279
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,380
you so why b19 trying to navigate this

280
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,000
crazy difficult dating culture where

281
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,860
there's successful men all around the

282
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,019
world that through Instagram and all of

283
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,540
these other mediums have access to all

284
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:05,040
these women why would you at 19 try to

285
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,779
compete with that either you have that

286
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,660
serious girl that holds it down for you

287
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:11,279
or don't try to casual date if you want

288
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,839
a casual date and have your fun and

289
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,459
listen I'm speaking to someone who has

290
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,019
had both sides of the equation into the

291
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:17,940
state I still like to have my fun

292
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,760
there's nothing wrong with it but I put

293
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,140
my head down and work like a dog for

294
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,880
years and years and I remember even

295
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,140
being 19 20 and being a

296
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,940
multi-millionaire and I said to myself

297
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,220
what's the point of me really focusing

298
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,140
on women and having fun and enjoying

299
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,720
myself with all these women when girls

300
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,920
don't want guys for 19 or 20 and you

301
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,959
need to understand this as a guy you

302
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,480
become most attractive once you get past

303
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,040
the age of 25 really from 25 to 35 is

304
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,660
when you're most attractive to women and

305
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,220
it really only starts at 25. so I

306
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,600
remember even being 19 or 20 and I'm

307
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,860
like yes this is great I'm a

308
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,779
multi-millionaire I'm all these things

309
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,459
but like let me just keep working like

310
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,959
I'm on a roll like all momentum let me

311
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:54,000
just keep this going rather than trying

312
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,920
to have the most fun and date girls and

313
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,779
Bubba and all this crap so as I said no

314
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,399
casual dating either you are dating

315
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,019
someone serious that you're like this

316
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,760
woman could be that day one for me and

317
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,220
by the way that day one girl listen

318
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,399
please take this coming from me there is

319
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,320
nothing on Earth nothing on earth that

320
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,640
is more viable than that if you've got a

321
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,500
day one girl and you managed to get a

322
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,720
day one girl you know all these girls on

323
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,279
a y'all private job I have done and

324
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,080
still do all these things but I

325
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,660
understand that that does not come

326
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,519
remotely close to a day one girl who is

327
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,380
there from you from the jump from day

328
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,000
one so either aim for that because by

329
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,740
the way that is the most valuable thing

330
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,899
you could ever get in life I'm telling

331
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,820
you this so either you get that or just

332
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:35,040
don't casual date because you are in

333
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,660
your building phase you have so long

334
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,459
especially as a man and I know I keep

335
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,800
talking to men and I understand that

336
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:42,779
there's a I think 10 of my audience is

337
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,279
women and I always do say I make content

338
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,779
specifically for men because I grew up

339
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,579
without a dad I had to learn all this

340
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,019
myself so that's why I speak to the

341
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,760
young men out there but I know a lot of

342
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:52,260
women still watch my videos and take

343
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,060
lessons from it and stuff like that so

344
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,220
as I was saying keep your head down keep

345
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,420
focused no casual dating and

346
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,040
then once you've made something of

347
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,540
yourself pop your head up and and then

348
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,579
you can have a little bit of fun before

349
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,560
eventually hopefully one day you find

350
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:06,779
your actual Queen principle number five

351
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,339
is keep your circles small but your

352
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:10,620
influence large and here's what I mean

353
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:12,480
by that there is nothing wrong with many

354
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,459
people knowing you or with you having

355
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,959
many acquaintances but you should have

356
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:17,820
very few friends and here's the thing

357
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,140
most people in this fake life

358
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,880
don't know the difference between an

359
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,380
acquaintance and a friend because most

360
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,120
people don't understand what true

361
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,440
loyalty is they are around people that

362
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,300
they don't like they're around people

363
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,980
for clout or money and this and that and

364
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,320
that's why by the way it's so important

365
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,300
to get yourself strong first so this way

366
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,579
people later down line can't throw money

367
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,839
or women or clout at you and you're

368
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,040
impressed by it you need to make

369
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,720
yourself strong you need to make

370
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,339
yourself a fortress but back to the

371
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,040
point keep your circle tight but you're

372
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:45,360
influence large many people can and

373
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,800
should know of you and I'm not talking

374
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,000
about having a massive social media

375
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,860
following or this or that I just mean

376
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,959
even in the industry you're in never

377
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,940
unnecessarily burn Bridges always be

378
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,440
very polite and courteous to people but

379
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,839
always understand that you can probably

380
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,760
only have a select handful of true

381
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,200
friends true Brothers in Arms true

382
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,700
people that will love you and do

383
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,800
anything for you that's a very very

384
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,839
small circle so your circle of influence

385
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,240
can and should be large but keep your

386
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,040
actual Circle solid and full of good

387
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,019
people the next principle you need to

388
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,000
follow is that God will always test you

389
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,860
to see what you can handle and if you

390
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,880
can't he will take it away from you and

391
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,560
this is very very important because

392
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,360
becoming successful and making your

393
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,220
first million in your teens or your

394
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,380
early 20s that's great congratulations

395
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,760
can you keep it now and not only can you

396
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,019
keep it can you multiply it because

397
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,279
that's a lot of pressure listen if you

398
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,740
make your first million dollars when

399
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,720
you're 18 or you're 20 or you're you

400
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,279
know even 23 that's great but that's a

401
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,320
lot of pressure every year after that

402
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,000
can you hold that same standard so you

403
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,339
need to understand that God If He

404
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,440
blesses you if he gives you that million

405
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:44,940
at a young age he's gonna see if you can

406
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,440
handle it he's gonna see if you can

407
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,420
humble yourself that's why earlier I

408
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,740
told you have things external in your

409
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,899
life that will constantly humble you

410
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,160
business martial arts setting challenges

411
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,779
for yourself and seeing if you can

412
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,760
accomplish things that really make you

413
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:58,139
dig deep because here's the thing if you

414
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,459
don't have these external things to

415
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,620
Humble you if you don't humble yourself

416
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:04,380
God will humble you and when God humbles

417
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,180
you it's with a ferocity you can't even

418
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,100
imagine because you're not ready for it

419
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,600
yet as quickly as it's given it's taken

420
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,040
away and you need to understand these

421
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,420
things so as long as you go into it with

422
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,620
a mindset that when you make your first

423
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,660
million you're not going to be driving

424
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,880
around in the G-Wagon and you're gonna

425
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,500
go to the bank like a idiot and take out

426
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,180
thirty thousand dollars in cash so that

427
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,860
way you can do an Instagram story where

428
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,360
you spread all the money in your hands

429
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,000
and now all you do is listen to little

430
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,740
baby in your rented G-Wagon and pop

431
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,660
bottles at the beach club and now your

432
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,220
business is just on autopilot God will

433
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,839
put you in your place so before that

434
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,399
happens put other things in place I've

435
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,440
already given a few but even if you can

436
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,240
get an older Mentor an older Confidant

437
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,459
to look at you and be like you ain't

438
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,320
doing it once is nothing special you're

439
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,000
only a legend if you can do it back to

440
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,980
back to back that's when you're a legend

441
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,500
now the last principle to tie it all

442
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,899
together is invest early and invest as

443
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,760
much as you can here is the thing if you

444
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:55,200
make money at a young age try to get

445
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,639
away from you as soon as possible I'm

446
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,560
talking about property I'm talking about

447
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,880
maybe even buying some physical gold I'm

448
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,040
talking about things where the money can

449
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,720
get away from you and it's not easy to

450
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,040
sell here's the issue sometimes and I'm

451
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,360
not totally opposed to it here's

452
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,160
sometimes the issue with crypto or

453
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,899
stocks you can buy and sell very easily

454
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,820
you can't buy and sell real estate very

455
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,920
easily so buying things that aren't

456
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,180
actually very liquid at a young age I

457
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,560
think later down the line once you're

458
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,940
established that can actually be a

459
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,260
detriment actually makes things a little

460
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,360
bit more difficult but when you're a

461
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,800
young age you are your worst enemy

462
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,300
you're the probably the biggest reason

463
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,500
you're gonna this up so what you

464
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,820
want to do is once you make money push

465
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,899
it away as quick as possible because

466
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,639
here's the other thing and once again

467
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,079
I'm talking from experience when you are

468
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,040
young and you make a lot of money you

469
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,899
know what people think people don't

470
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,120
think oh well done people think you got

471
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:38,160
lucky so there's no point being 19 years

472
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,180
old driving all these supercars and blah

473
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,620
blah all this stuff because you're not

474
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,360
impressing anyone people just think

475
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,339
you're lucky that's it you're better off

476
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,199
taking the money investing it and when

477
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:47,940
you're 23 you're 25 you get to an age

478
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:49,500
where people can kind of believe this

479
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,180
has happened a little bit more maybe you

480
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,440
know you're 22 but you're dressed apart

481
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,880
and people think you're a little older

482
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,199
and that's when you can enjoy and you

483
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,579
can live it up and you can do these

484
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,079
things because when you get out of your

485
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:59,699
Supercar people will actually think that

486
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,440
you bought that but when you're 19 and

487
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:03,120
you look young people will either think

488
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,699
you got lucky they're going to think you

489
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,139
invest in some pump and dumb coin or

490
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:08,519
they're gonna think Daddy's money so

491
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,899
while you're trying to flex and let's be

492
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,100
honest if you're young and you're buying

493
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:12,660
these supercars you're probably trying

494
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,220
to flex it's not even having the

495
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,779
intended effect so just tell yourself

496
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,579
you know what any money that comes in

497
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:19,260
I'm gonna invest as much as I humanly

498
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:20,579
can I'm gonna make myself solid and I'm

499
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,440
gonna enjoy these things a little later

500
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:24,120
down the line so ladies and gentlemen I

501
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,800
present to you these principles as

502
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,360
someone who can speak to you more

503
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,620
realistically because let's be honest a

504
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,019
lot of these YouTube videos you watch

505
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,639
online are some 50 year olds that lived

506
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:34,440
in a different generation and don't

507
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,120
understand that hey there's nothing

508
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,380
wrong with wanting beautiful women

509
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,660
around you there's nothing wrong with

510
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,800
wanting money having nice cars all these

511
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,300
things there's nothing wrong with that

512
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,500
but there's a way to do it there's a

513
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,240
time and a place so I'm just coming here

514
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,220
and speaking to you guys from experience

515
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,779
and trying to meet you guys of where you

516
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,860
are which is not trying to shame you for

517
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,720
the things you want in life but just

518
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,519
telling you there is a way to do it and

519
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,500
there's a right timing to do things so

520
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,360
as I said I hope this has been a value

521
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,279

522
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,320
