1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:07,720
it has never been harder to win than

2
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:10,400
right now why because every single day

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,960
you are frying your brain you are

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,680
killing your attention span and you are

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,520
killing your focus you're killing your

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,960
testosterone and because of all of that

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,240
you are killing your success the average

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,679
person has a worse attention span than a

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,240
goldfish and that's who you're competing

10
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:30,160
against so on the good news that means

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,399
that just with the tiniest bit of

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,600
discipline and work ethic you are

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,960
already ahead of 90% of people and

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,000
before we even begin you need to

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,840
understand that your ability to control

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,920
your urges is directly correlated to

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,079
your success or lack thereof if you

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,199
cannot control yourself if you cannot be

19
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:53,600
disciplined you will never be successful

20
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:56,280
it is simply impossible and that is why

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,800
it's so important for you to master your

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,399
urges and all of that starts with

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,199
desexualizing your brain so that you are

24
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:07,200
no longer ruled by your primate brain so

25
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,360
today I'm going to give you the only six

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,960
steps you need to desexualize your brain

27
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,520
and regain control of your life because

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,720
it's having that very control over your

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,640
mind your body and your life that will

30
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,920
ultimately lead you to success now

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,159
here's the interesting part truly

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,320
desexualizing your brain actually has

33
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,119
very little to do with sex and has

34
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,040
everything to do with something else but

35
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,960
I will get to that a little later in the

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,880
video so for now let's get into it the

37
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,799
first step is to stop watching porn

38
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,159
first and foremost you need to stop

39
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,560
watching porn now listen this may sound

40
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,600
obvious yet 99% of young people simply

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,799
cannot stop I would say that watching

42
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,840
porn is by far the worst way which you

43
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,119
sexualize your brain and let me explain

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,759
to you why you see the problem isn't

45
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,079
just the amount of time that you spend

46
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,920
watching porn I mean sure if you stopped

47
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,159
you'd have an extra hour per week or or

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,079
something like that but that's just a

49
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,360
very minuscule side effect compared to

50
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,920
the rest you see porn literally fries

51
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,120
your brain and robs you a focus don't

52
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,560
believe me just look at the science

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,480
there have been multiple studies that

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,879
link porn usage to the erosion of your

55
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,120
prefrontal cortex you know that part of

56
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,840
your brain that regulates your emotions

57
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,800
your actions and more importantly your

58
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,360
impulse control and willpower but that

59
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,200
is just the tip of the iceberg there is

60
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,760
a laundry list of negative side effects

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,040
that have been linked to porn use why

62
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,720
because porn use has similar effects on

63
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,599
the brain as substance abuse porn has

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,000
been linked to issues like decreased

65
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:45,879
focused and increased anxiety and

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,200
depression now as if these problems

67
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,239
weren't big enough porn has also been

68
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,560
linked to trouble in long-term

69
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,080
relationships and of course impotency in

70
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,360
fact there is an epidemic of young men

71
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,239
who are experiencing sexual issues like

72
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,080
erectile dysfunction because their brain

73
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,040
has been rewired it's unfortunate

74
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,239
because these young men have consumed so

75
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,400
much porn that their neural Pathways

76
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,159
have literally changed I mean they've

77
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,879
effectively trained themselves to be

78
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,879
aroused by watching others do the deed

79
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,120
instead of doing it themselves and porn

80
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,200
users even reported that they are less

81
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,560
satisfied with their lives than their

82
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,519
counterparts who don't watch porn now

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,159
the second step in desexualizing your

84
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,439
brain goes hand inand with quitting porn

85
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:33,640
and that is you need to stop pleasuring

86
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,239
yourself look I understand it's

87
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,200
addictive and I understand that it's

88
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,400
been normalized in today's day and age

89
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,080
but there is nothing healthy or normal

90
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,959
about it and not even because the very

91
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,120
Act is so terrible as it is with porn

92
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:47,040
it's actually just because the

93
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,480
consequences of it you see every time

94
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,040
you do it your dopamine surges I mean

95
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,280
you're pretty much signaling to your

96
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,879
brain that you have accomplished what is

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,040
supposed to be man's highest goal to

98
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:59,680
procreate you are essentially telling

99
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,319
your brain that you've done the most

100
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,640
most important thing you'll do all day

101
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,959
now of course you and I both know that

102
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,319
that's not true but the neurons firing

103
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,799
in your brain do not and that is why you

104
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,879
are rewarded for it that is why it's

105
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,079
cheap dopamine because you are tricking

106
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:18,120
your own brain into giving you dopamine

107
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,880
you have not earned and that's why your

108
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,639
ability to focus and your ability to do

109
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,479
hard things plummets because how do you

110
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,440
think that the real world will stack up

111
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:29,479
to the dopamine and other chemical

112
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,120
releases that you're getting from doing

113
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:33,560
the the very thing we have been

114
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,280
evolutionarily designed to do well the

115
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,800
answer is it won't stack up at all I

116
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,800
mean no wonder you can't focus when your

117
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,720
dopamine receptors are so fried this is

118
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,560
why you can't focus I mean listen of

119
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,800
course everything else will feel boring

120
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,759
when you've just done the dirty business

121
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,600
and this is why you need to stop so you

122
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,199
ask yourself why do so many young men

123
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,240
keep doing it because they are addicted

124
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,039
they are addicted to cheap dopamine in

125
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,919
the exact same way that people get

126
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,479
addicted to drugs I mean in fact port

127
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,240
and masturbation are the most difficult

128
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,160
addictions to break why because of the

129
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,800
insane dopamine Spike that is caused by

130
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,600
it so real quick let's just look at the

131
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,600
data if you eat a delicious burger or

132
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,160
some other carb filled meal your

133
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,000
dopamine levels will Spike by 100% now

134
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,400
if you smoke or get some other form of

135
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
nicotine your dopamine will Spike by

136
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,400
200% whereas porn and masturbation

137
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,880
boosts your dopamine by over

138
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,120
250% the exact same is sex now here's

139
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,199
the key difference porn and masturbation

140
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,919
will then make your dopamine levels fall

141
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,440
way below Baseline and that's where

142
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:45,720
those lethargic feelings come from after

143
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,400
that's the exact same dopamine curve you

144
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,520
get from drugs so then that really

145
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,080
starts to beg the question how the hell

146
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,120
do you stop and here is where it gets

147
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,280
interesting you see an addiction to por

148
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,520
and masturbation isn't actually rooted

149
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,199
in anything sexual at all and that leads

150
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,840
us onto the Third step of how you can

151
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,080
desexualize your brain number three

152
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,599
purpose now they actually did a study

153
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,199
where they tried to figure out what

154
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:13,120
causes these addictions and the answer

155
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,639
may surprise you you see it wasn't

156
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,520
actually any form of perversion it

157
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,960
wasn't childhood trauma it wasn't

158
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,280
extraordinary libido instead it was

159
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,919
something far simpler far more

160
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,400
rudimentary it was meaninglessness

161
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,880
simply put if you don't have a purpose

162
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
if you don't have a goal if you don't

163
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,080
have something that you are striving

164
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,240
towards then you are more likely to

165
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,720
devolve in these addictions now the good

166
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,599
news is it's fixable every man should

167
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,919
have that purpose that North Star that

168
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:44,639
drives him forward you simply need

169
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:46,400
something better to do with your time

170
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,240
than giv to your urges what that

171
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,960
something is will depend on the person

172
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,759
now from an early age we are taught that

173
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,759
we need a good college education and a

174
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,360
corporate job as though that's somehow

175
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,599
going to fulfill us but we both know

176
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,520
that that's definitely not not true is

177
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:05,759
it in fact that's not true at all and

178
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,479
from October 30th to November 6th I'm

179
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,080
going to expose how and why you have

180
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,120
been indoctrinated to believe this and

181
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,520
most importantly I'm going to show you

182
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,039
how to escape their indoctrination and

183
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,720
earn back your freedom so if you want to

184
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,840
be a part of that free online event then

185
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:26,080
sign up with the link below anyways we

186
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,440
all need something to guide us for some

187
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,000
it'll be starting a business for others

188
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,520
it might be something entirely different

189
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,440
I can tell you that for me personally my

190
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,680
North Star was to be able to take care

191
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,680
of my mom and my loved ones and that is

192
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,199
why I went into business because I had

193
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,720
that North Star to guide me and honestly

194
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,599
without that North Star I can

195
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,479
confidently say that I would have given

196
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:49,520
up because the money isn't enough to

197
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,400
keep you going you need that North Star

198
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,879
you need that why that purpose but even

199
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,360
then once you have your purpose you may

200
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,879
still slip up why because there are

201
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,319
triggers out there that cause you to do

202
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,759
so and this leads into our fourth step

203
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,080
in desexualizing your brain step number

204
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:10,800
four stop watching soft porn you see

205
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,199
soft porn can be just as bad as porn

206
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,120
because it's everywhere everywhere you

207
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,960
look there are half naked girls I mean

208
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,680
you scroll endlessly through Tik Tok and

209
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,039
Instagram and the algorithm is

210
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,960
reinforced by your desire to look at

211
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,560
these girls and that is why I need you

212
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,520
to unfollow all of the Instagram models

213
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,599
unfollow all the Tik Tok girls to do

214
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,399
their little dances because they are

215
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,360
eating away at your focus they are

216
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,599
destroying your future and it may seem

217
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,440
minuscule to you but it's not you see

218
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,200
most of the time you don't just randomly

219
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,880
decide to watch porn there is a trigger

220
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,480
and that's why the best way to quit porn

221
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,160
is by eliminating the triggers that make

222
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,320
you watch it and that means you need to

223
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,560
also stop watching soft porn and every

224
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,560
time the algorithm shows you half naked

225
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:03,120
girls simply click not interest Ed train

226
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,720
the algorithm to not show you those

227
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,760
things and listen of course the best

228
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,519
case scenario is you just quit Tik Tok

229
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,440
and Instagram alog together because

230
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,200
really at the end of the day you have no

231
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,000
business looking at memes or whatever

232
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,839
else if you are not where you want to be

233
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,640
in life and if these social media

234
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,680
platforms don't directly help your

235
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,720
business but in any case The Next Step

236
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,519
you need to take in order to desexualize

237
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,519
your brain is to focus Inward and not

238
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,720
outward you see the biggest problem with

239
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,320
the sexualization of your brain

240
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,040
stems from the changes that are

241
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,200
happening in your dopamine system the

242
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,040
sexualization of your brain impairs your

243
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,880
ability to do hard work because your

244
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,640
brain becomes so used to cheap dopamine

245
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,560
and that's why the next step requires

246
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,680
you to learn delayed gratification

247
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,279
instead of constantly looking outwards

248
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,360
for stimulus and dopamine you need to

249
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:53,240
learn to look inward now you might be

250
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,279
asking what does that actually mean it

251
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,079
means that 99% of people get their

252
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,959
so-called Happiness by doing fun things

253
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:02,839
whether those things be a Sinister as

254
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:05,120
porn or as innocent as chocolate but if

255
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,880
you truly want to be successful that

256
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,120
cannot be you now I'm not saying that

257
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,640
you need to cut every single source of

258
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,320
dopamine from your life but you

259
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,640
definitely need to think about what's

260
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,160
helping you and what's hurting you and

261
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,680
over the years I routinely do a dopamine

262
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,800
detox this is where for a certain amount

263
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,959
of time usually between 24 to 72 hours

264
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:28,040
you do nothing no food no phone not even

265
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,760
books or music and certainly no porn

266
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,600
just complete Stillness you need to

267
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,680
become used to finding peace without

268
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,399
these external stimuli because the goal

269
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,680
is for you to be so fulfilled by your

270
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,720
work that you eventually get those same

271
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,880
dopamine releases by doing hard things

272
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,720
you see dopamine is nothing but a reward

273
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,279
system it's the way that your brain has

274
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,880
evolved to reinforce behaviors that will

275
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:53,480
increase your chances of survival and

276
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,839
that is why sex spikes your dopam so

277
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,040
much because without procreation I mean

278
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,000
we wouldn't exist but in today's world

279
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,760
social media and food has hijacked those

280
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,360
same systems and that is why it is your

281
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:08,200
job to regain your control over them so

282
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,240
stop seeking cheap dopamine externally

283
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,480
and instead look Inward and that is how

284
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,720
you desexualize your brain and realign

285
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,680
your actions with your goals now the

286
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,000
final thing is you need to stop chasing

287
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,120
women and build yourself first listen

288
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,320
you will never be able to truly Focus

289
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,279
inward if you are constantly chasing

290
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,040
women if you're texting this girl

291
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:30,079
meeting up with that girl all while

292
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,360
thinking about some other girls you will

293
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,600
never be focused that is not how you

294
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,519
desexualize your brain which is exactly

295
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,120
why I always say that you need to stop

296
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:40,920
chasing women and build yourself up

297
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,800
first the best part is when you do

298
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,000
eventually build yourself into man of

299
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,839
substance the women just inevitably come

300
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,399
to you but until you get to that level

301
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:51,839
chasing women is just a massive waste of

302
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:54,320
time unless it's your day one girl

303
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,680
unless you know hey this girl this will

304
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,959
be my future wife but if that isn't you

305
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,440
it's a waste of time for two reasons

306
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,560
number one the quality of women you can

307
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,040
get at the beginning of your journey is

308
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,440
nothing compared to what you'll be able

309
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,800
to get later down the line you see women

310
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,440
date up in the social hierarchy which

311
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,760
means the best quality women will

312
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,959
inevitably end up with the best quality

313
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,120
men so that's why you need to spend time

314
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,519
molding yourself to be the best version

315
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,160
of yourself that you could possibly be

316
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,560
and I'm not only talking about just

317
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,920
money here by the way now the second

318
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,120
reason it's a waste is because if you

319
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,839
somehow manage to get a highquality girl

320
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,360
the amount of effort and time that it

321
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,120
will take you is massive so you really

322
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,800
need to analyze the opportunity cost

323
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,079
here because going on a date with a girl

324
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,440
spending $100 or a few hundred bucks to

325
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,160
try to impress her has far greater

326
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,360
complications look I'm not saying you

327
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,040
should be an antisocial weirdo but you

328
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,480
need to set your priorities straight

329
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,839
listen in the same way that they tell

330
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,160
you to put on your own oxygen mask first

331
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,160
in the plane you need to be able to hold

332
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,880
your own before you let someone else

333
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,440
into your life because listen at the end

334
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,760
of the day dating is a massive

335
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,160
distraction and when you're first

336
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,279
getting started in your business or your

337
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,399
career you'll need all the time and

338
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,839
focus that you can muster because no

339
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,560
step of the journey is harder than the

340
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,839
first one and that is why you need

341
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,680
undivided attention I mean listen after

342
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,480
all you just need 1 to 3 years of pure

343
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,440
focus and then you can live a normal

344
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,240
life again but you need to be willing to

345
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,480
make that sacrifice because let me tell

346
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,800
you something if you are constantly

347
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,079
thinking about this girl and that girl

348
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,880
and which girl to see tonight there's no

349
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,399
way that you will be able to desexualize

350
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,920
your brain and channel your focus into

351
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,360
what really matters and once you Channel

352
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,800
your focus into what really matters

353
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,160
everything else will fall into place so

354
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,519
just focus on yourself first so

355
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,600
gentlemen pick yourself up focus on the

356
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,160
right things and as always I'll be

357
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,160
watching from afar and I'm rooting for

358
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,160
you
