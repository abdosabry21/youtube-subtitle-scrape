1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:05,759
so these at 148 models honestly what

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,919
would be the maximum budget that you

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,660
would want to spend this couch to two

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,360
chairs it would cost about four hundred

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,679
thousand dollars so the G550 this is the

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,299
out what it looks like outside that

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,520
airplane is going to cost about 3.6

8
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,740
million dollars a year to run it

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,600
it's hard to hate on the truth I'm

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,340
living enough men hey with Elijah

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,260
instead counting cash with the phone

12
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,859
through my ear I feel like Meek on a

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,859
private jet

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,660
we are in Liverpool doing some final

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,280
taste tests for it's quite cool that

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,140
we're able to come to the manufacturing

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,000
plant because they don't normally let

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,860
this happen the suburbs are filled with

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,899
ebonics and trap Sonics and then what's

20
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,719
the sodium content like in lecture

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,980
profile

22
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:52,079
yeah so we've got sweet but slightly

23
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,039
more electrolyzing so it's the same in

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,840
terms of sodium potassium chloride

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,640
magnesium there's like

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,879
because you smell it it smells like a

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,100
smells quite intense and you drink it

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,280
it's like an odd flavor yeah it's odd it

29
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,520
doesn't taste it and then after it's

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,520
nice

31
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,640
during that I think it fixes it oh yeah

32
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,640
this one's much better

33
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,500
oh wow your favorite candy

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,740
I like this one a lot yeah this one's

35
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,299
nice I actually think this one's my

36
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,939
favorite one out of all of the flavors

37
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,979
so far try that because you you've drunk

38
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,900
yeah

39
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,180
that's great yeah it doesn't even taste

40
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,860
like if you know that this is really

41
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,600
healthy for you it just makes it 10

42
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,280
times more enjoyable no but I'm I'm

43
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,960
dying right now you'll never ever sell

44
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,460
me on a bottle ever he's gonna try that

45
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,460
every time we see it right

46
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:57,180
so after a heavy morning of testing you

47
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,740
come down to six flavors from probably I

48
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,259
think we've had 40 50 different

49
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,180
variations so came back after lunch had

50
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,680
some more prepared and yeah we have six

51
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,380
in front of us unfortunately we can only

52
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,580
launch two to start with so I guess it's

53
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,360
time to decide

54
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,360

55
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,640

very good we are going to the jet

114
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,840
business it's a jet business started by

115
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,220
a guy called Steve I remember when I

116
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,020
used to live in London I saw it for

117
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,819
years like I would see a walking just

118
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,740
here on Park Lane hear about to

119
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,300
Knightsbridge and I always used to see a

120
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,860
jet and you don't really ever see that

121
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,660
in London or really anywhere in the

122
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,520
world like a physical store for

123
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,319
purchasing Jets like you know you've got

124
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,940
real estate agents and stuff like that

125
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,139
and come in you can see some houses

126
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,000
stuff like that but you've never got

127
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,440
something like that for jets but yeah

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,240
now that things are kind of progressing

129
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,560
along a little better and it's something

130
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,180
that I've been looking at a little bit

131
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,979
more not yet I want to make that clear

132
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,840
not yet but within the next one to two

133
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,639
years yeah I thought we'd go along have

134
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,620
a chat with Steve and then also maybe

135
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,419
give you guys a little bit of insight

136
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,860
and context into the jet business how it

137
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,840
works I'll probably even get him to talk

138
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,160
about jet chartering I know a lot of you

139
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,440
guys are curious how much does it cost

140
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,419
to actually fly private is it stupid

141
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,000
what are the kind of planes so we'll run

142
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:09,860
through all that with Steve ambitious 14

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,860
year old grades going down and some

144
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:16,560
my favorite phrase is time is money buy

145
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,539
a jet so I mean it really is uh the

146
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,280
whole base is on an airplane I'm always

147
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:22,319
saying you know it's not about luxuries

148
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,319
it's really about a time machine and

149
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,960
being a capital asset to a company this

150
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,120
is a club room where sometimes like

151
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,120
right now you know we have a client in

152
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,860
in the main Studio there and so if we

153
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,479
really want to I have another video well

154
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,120
here that I can do another presentation

155
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,280
on however this one I can't do the full

156
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,539
floor plan of all the airplanes and I'll

157
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,460
show you I'll take you through the app

158
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,380
on that wall because it's just much more

159
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,419
effective it's one of these experiential

160
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,800
Journeys if you want to call it that if

161
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,360
you're really interested in trying to

162
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,800
buy an airplane this it's an

163
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,419
unbelievable tool so this is a little

164
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,099
bit more of a private

165
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:58,020
um kind of action I know it's an ashtray

166
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:59,720
there you got smoke in here you can do

167
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,099
whatever you want here

168
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,880
why is clown side Delight to highlight

169
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:08,759
the chicks this is a Airbus 319 Airbus

170
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,380
320 actual cross-section of of the

171
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,880
aircraft I didn't really buy uh build

172
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,560
this thing in here put it in the front

173
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,479
window really to sell air buses or

174
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,220
boeings the real reason was obviously is

175
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,319
a marketing gimmick to catch the

176
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,660
people's eyes in the window here on Park

177
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,340
Lane hear about the Knightsbridge I

178
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,500
always used to see a jet

179
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,360
a good marketing little place this is

180
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,979
really the the money shot people come

181
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,080
driving down this road and there's about

182
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,580
well pre-covered there was about 90 000

183
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,719
Vehicles every day going up and down

184
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,820
here about

185
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:37,140
um 40 people who own a jet every day

186
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,760
passing through this window and about

187
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,099
half are different every day so what we

188
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,500
do is at night time we take this little

189
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,300
advertisement or video and we put it

190
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,800
over here so at night everything is

191
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,660
black around here and then so when they

192
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,920
drive down they see this little video in

193
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,480
the window and then they see the

194
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,279
airplane then they see inside the window

195
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,080
and if they have anything to do with

196
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,000
corporate aircraft normally they will

197
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,519
find the time to come back here and and

198
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,380
come inside a couple carrots in my ears

199
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,120
enough cards for me I'm feeling like the

200
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,600
local scene finally cherishing me so

201
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,300
these are 148 models what we do now is

202
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,399
we have to figure out a a sensible way

203
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,980
to filter the airplanes out that don't

204
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,620
meet your parameters honestly what would

205
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,800
be the maximum maximum budget that you

206
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:22,140
would want to spend 30 mil okay do you

207
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,300
want to have one section two sections or

208
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,339
three sections there's four or five or

209
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,140
six people in a section what do you

210
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,060
think is

211
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,800
eight minimum so now we're down to 58.

212
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:35,040
the next one is the maximum range so the

213
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,140
longest trip from A to B where do you

214
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,899
think that would be five or six times a

215
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,600
year I'd say farthest realistic maybe

216
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:44,519
Dubai to London this is the range that

217
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,160
you can go non-stop okay so anywhere in

218
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:50,279
Europe you can make it to South Africa

219
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:53,220
and you can make it to Singapore however

220
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:56,459
this is with no wind right so now this

221
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,620
was the winds last week at 35 000 feet

222
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:00,480
so what this means is that you're going

223
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,860
to be able to fly faster when you're

224
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,260
going east and you're not going to be

225
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,760
able to go as far on Range or it's going

226
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,220
to take you longer when you're going

227
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,440
west you can see that here you can make

228
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,420
Singapore with all these airplanes but

229
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,880
if you were to start now in Singapore

230
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,620
and watch this this is so you can see if

231
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,860
I go to Singapore

232
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,660
you are just barely matter of fact if

233
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,700
the winds get a little bit worse and get

234
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,220
the 75 knots average you're not going to

235
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,140
make it back in that g280. one of the

236
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,519
things people don't ever ask which they

237
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,440
absolutely should ask is how much

238
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,500
baggage can I put in my airplane you can

239
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,860
see that this number is the 6.4 cubic

240
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,959
meters of luggage and this is half and I

241
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,120
can tell you this is a nightmare

242
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,560
question every time somebody has an

243
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,079
airplane they never ask this question

244
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:49,560
and this is the most important thing of

245
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,740
every flight so this is 100 scale okay

246
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,779
so I'm six foot I'm 180. this is the

247
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,579
exact size and so if I wanted to take

248
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,339
let's say the seats on the Gulf Stream

249
00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:01,500
and compare it to the Challenger that's

250
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,360
the difference in Iowa that doesn't look

251
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,279
like too big of a deal you're getting a

252
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,839
little bit more eyewith but really where

253
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,360
you see the difference is when we look

254
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,360
at the as a floor plan so this this is

255
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,980
100 scale of the Gulfstream 550. you got

256
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,260
the kitchen door here the galley door

257
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,240
and most airplanes the front section has

258
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:21,600
these 4 or single seats this is the

259
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,820
really the normal setup so the G550 this

260
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,019
is the out what it looks like outside

261
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,760
and this is what it looks like inside

262
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,500
you can see it's got those three

263
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,180
sections this is the door that closes

264
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,040
off and you got that bedroom back there

265
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,200
and the bathroom behind it this

266
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,760
airplane's got for the class it's got

267
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,060
the biggest window see how big that

268
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,860
window is yeah it's huge window this is

269
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,660
twice the size of let's say the windows

270
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,000
on the airlines up front you have a

271
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,459
really big kitchen flight attendant can

272
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,320
prepare anything they bring your food

273
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:51,779
from Whole Foods or you can get it from

274
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,880
Harry's Bar or you know wherever you

275
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,899
want it and it's you can get it from

276
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,339
whatever your place you want but it's

277
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,720
nice when it's prepared fresh on the

278
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:59,820
airplane I'd say this airplane You're

279
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,820
Gonna Fly at 350 hours a year and you're

280
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,100
going to pay 450 dollars a gallon okay

281
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,019
that airplane is going to cost about 3.6

282
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,399
million dollars a year to run it okay

283
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,720
which is about ten thousand an hour

284
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,640
really the main thing there's three

285
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,740
things you could do to Interior the soft

286
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,959
goods which is all the fabric whether

287
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,000
it's the the side panels the ceiling the

288
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:20,100
seats the carpet that kind of stuff then

289
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,480
the other part is the color of the wood

290
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,980
and then the other one is moving

291
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,519
furniture around to move furniture

292
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,800
around is very very expensive they have

293
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,140
to redo engineering drawings I mean

294
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,540
literally on a G550 just to give you an

295
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,760
idea if you wanted to change this couch

296
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,680
to two chairs it would cost about four

297
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,660
hundred thousand dollars what percentage

298
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,399
of jet owners would you say just

299
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,260
genuinely have it for personal use or

300
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,820
corporate use two-thirds it's one

301
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,040
one-third of all airplanes are out on

302
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,360
the charter as a third party Chargers

303
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,380
because I think that's probably one of

304
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,420
the things that most people don't

305
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,980
understand it's okay cool very nice you

306
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,959
bought your jet this that now you're

307
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,779
down three million dollars a year just

308
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,940
to maintain and upkeep it are you seeing

309
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:01,320
them more and more jet owners are buying

310
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,839
it understanding that you know for

311
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,980
example my position I'm spending me four

312
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,139
or five hundred thousand dollars a year

313
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,779
on jet Charters you know why don't when

314
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:12,060
I buy a jet myself and then why don't I

315
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:13,560
Charter it out in the meantime well that

316
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,880
is a great question when you're

317
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,980
operating it when you have an airplane

318
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,560
the budget is broken up in two things

319
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,139
you got fixed cost and you have variable

320
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,779
costs fixed cost is what you have to pay

321
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,820
whether you fly one hour or 400 hours

322
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:28,860
okay it's the pilot salaries it's

323
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,360
insurance it's the hangar all those

324
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,700
things whether you move the airplane or

325
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,700
not you pay and then every hour you fly

326
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:38,639
it you have fuel Landing fees catering

327
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,680
Pilots hotels Euro control flight all

328
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,959
that kind of stuff so the variable cost

329
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,060
per hour is five thousand seven hundred

330
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,800
dollars so if you're flying 400 hours a

331
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,620
year it costs you four thousand an hour

332
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,560
fixed Cost Plus

333
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,779
15 so it's 9 500 an hour but if you

334
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,060
start flying more hours then this is

335
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:59,040
less per hour so it's cheaper to fly per

336
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,139
hour the more you fly it if you're able

337
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,420
to Charter this airplane for 12 000 an

338
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:06,120
hour dollars we're talking about and

339
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,100
every hour this question you half that

340
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,920
that means you're making six thousand

341
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,200
dollars an hour profit not including

342
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,540
fixed cost if you can uh Charter the

343
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,880
airplane out for 200 hours that's 200

344
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,160
times six you're making a profit of 1.2

345
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,959
million dollars that comes off of this

346
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,820
and now your fixed costs are only four

347
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:26,100
hundred thousand so if you're flying now

348
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,899
if half to 200 hours in your and you're

349
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,480
renting enough 200 hours if you get this

350
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:32,160
to 400 000 and you're flying 200 hours a

351
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,220
year it's two thousand dollars an hour

352
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,380
plus this so now it's costing you 7 500

353
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,120
an hour and the more you fly it the

354
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,279
cheaper it gets you'll say well I can go

355
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,779
rent it out 300 hours a year you can but

356
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,519
you know every other day you're going to

357
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:46,560
get a phone call you have to give owner

358
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,779
approval and you can say wow who is it

359
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,160
you know I just did the interior I don't

360
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,600
want them to have red wine I don't want

361
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,920
them to smoke I don't want to have a dog

362
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,420
I don't want to have a coffee yeah

363
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,820
because they're going to split on the

364
