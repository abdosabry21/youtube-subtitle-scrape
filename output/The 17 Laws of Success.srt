00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
ladies and gentlemen in today's video

2
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:05,420
I'm going to share with you the 17

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,919
success secrets of the top one percent

4
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,260
now what this means is that I'm gonna

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,420
show you an insight into what makes

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,059
millionaires millionaires but in fact

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,980
even farther than that I've been a very

8
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,680
fortunate situation to make tens of

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,600
millions of dollars in my 20s and have

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,640
an incredible audience that Tunes in and

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,560
listens to me and because I've worked

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,180
hard but also been incredibly blessed in

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,160
this life that's also meant that I've

14
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,900
had anyone you could ever imagine try to

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,520
reach out to me connect I'm talking the

16
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,320
richest men in certain countries that

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,940
literally play paddle and tennis with

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,440
I'm talking some of the highest level

19
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,120
football or some of the highest level

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,800
Formula One drivers I'm talking

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,960
self-made owners of some of the biggest

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,520
companies on Earth so the reason I tell

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,840
you this is because what I'm going to

24
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,040
share with you are things that I've

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,920
personally learned in my time

26
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,840
accomplishing a fair amount definitely a

27
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,700
very respectable amount but nowhere near

28
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,920
what some of these people that I spend

29
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,600
time with on a weekly basis what they've

30
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,920
accomplished so even though the title of

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,539
the video is to share with you the

32
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
secrets of the top one percent this is

33
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,320
really stuff that applies to the top

34
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,060
zero zero one percent in any given

35
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,920
industry so with no further Ado let's

36
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,600
get straight into it now real quick

37
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,000
before we get into this video all of

38
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,920
these concepts are very conceptual and

39
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,299
are life lessons that you need to apply

40
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,760
but I know for a lot of people watching

41
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,619
they want that hey do this do that don't

42
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,479
do this don't do that to actually start

43
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,460
with their own entrepreneurial venture

44
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,900
and to start making money online this

45
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,520
year and there's tons of good ways to do

46
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,259
it and tons of bad ways to do it so

47
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,640
after you finish watching this video I'd

48
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,560
recommend you check out the most popular

49
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,119
video on my YouTube channel where I

50
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,100
basically compare all the most popular

51
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,140
business models and actually break it

52
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,180
down with an equation and a formula what

53
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,579
works and what doesn't work and what you

54
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,079
should probably try based on your unique

55
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,939
skill sets so if you think that YouTube

56
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,860
video may be of interest I'll leave that

57
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,060
as a first line in the description and

58
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,280
you can watch that after you're done

59
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,500
with this anyways so the first secret of

60
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,659
the top one percent is they realize that

61
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,220
the woman they choose will be the most

62
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,860
important decision that they ever make

63
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,740
outside of work as men the thing that

64
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,780
consumes most of of our time is usually

65
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,180
women whether I be chasing women having

66
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,220
experiences having fun whatever doing

67
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,200
your thing being single spreading your

68
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,239
wings all that stuff which by the way I

69
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,400
have done plenty of in the past it's a

70
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,680
lot of fun enjoy yourself do it if you

71
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,300
want to do it and also don't ever let

72
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,760
anyone shame you into thinking that's

73
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,220
wrong it's not wrong at all but it is

74
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,720
undeniably a distraction so obviously to

75
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,040
build a brighter future the best thing

76
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,360
you can have by your side is an

77
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,580
incredible woman but at the end of the

78
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,440
day most men don't choose the right

79
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,760
woman to have by their side most men

80
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,080
that want to accomplish something big in

81
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,420
life don't have a partner that

82
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,459
understands their grand ambition and

83
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,680
understand that they need a safe space

84
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,420
at home if they're going out and they're

85
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,980
conquering and they're doing all of this

86
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,980
for their future family for their wife

87
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,780
at home it needs to be a safe space it

88
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,400
needs to be a safe loving nurturing

89
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,739
caring environment or at least that's

90
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,660
what applies to extremely ambitious men

91
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,819
which if you're watching this I assume

92
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,099
is a category of men that you fall into

93
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,800
so either men choose women that are too

94
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:04,379
turbulent or or and I see this a lot as

95
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,819
well men choose women simply based on

96
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,879
their looks and at the end of the day

97
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:11,459
looks fade looks fade and so does

98
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,220
attraction and I'm talking about some of

99
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,379
the most beautiful women on earth I'm

100
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,720
talking your 10 out of 10s I'm gonna be

101
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:20,340
very honest with you for every you know

102
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,739
beautiful girl 10 out of 10 you see

103
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,659
there is a man at home who's been with

104
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,239
that person for years and no matter how

105
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:29,099
beautiful she is

106
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,959
he's bored of her attraction he's bored

107
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,700
of her looks and that's just kind of

108
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,739
what we're like as men but so many guys

109
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,140
are so stupid and they think oh just

110
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,940
because she's pretty okay cool you know

111
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,200
she'll be the woman by my side it's very

112
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,239
foolish because if you have grand

113
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,640
Ambitions in life it's gonna get

114
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,959
turbulent and you need a good person by

115
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,879
your side and that's really what I've

116
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,500
noticed with the most successful men and

117
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,879
for me the most respectable men that

118
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,440
I've ever seen is listen if they wanted

119
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,299
to they had their turbulence in the past

120
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,500
like they they enjoyed themselves they

121
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,299
had their experiences they did whatever

122
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,739
they wanted to do and some men that I

123
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,720
meet that I really respect and are

124
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,040
multi-billionaires they've only had one

125
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,480
partner their entire life and that's

126
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,340
beautiful as well but whether you go

127
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,720
down the path of high school sweethearts

128
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,000
or whether you you know have your

129
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,920
Playboy era the destination needs to be

130
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,299
the same which is an incredible woman by

131
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,299
your side and a woman that you choose

132
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,739
not based purely on looks or oh if I go

133
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,419
to a dinner party and you know I got a

134
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:20,040
beautiful woman by my side I'll have

135
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:21,780
more respect because listen I can tell

136
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,580
you high level men they don't respect

137
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,020
that I think when I see a guy and he has

138
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,220
a beautiful woman by his side and I know

139
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,020
that it's just a little bit of fun for

140
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,820
him sure that's great but when that's

141
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,620
his Queen like that's a Woman by his

142
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,180
side and she's pretty and that's it but

143
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,680
she has no social intelligence or

144
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,540
they're at a dinner table and you know

145
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,400
she's on her phone or she just doesn't

146
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,540
really know how to represent her and her

147
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,940
man

148
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,440
what respect is there in that so just

149
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,240
understand for the men watching this and

150
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,699
as you guys know I speak specifically to

151
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,740
men but still shout out to the 10 or 12

152
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,060
of women that watch this as a man the

153
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,500
most important decision you will make in

154
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,660
your life is a woman that you have by

155
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,919
your side the second success secret and

156
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,380
this is something that Percy comes from

157
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,180
me and I tell people this all the time

158
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,220
everyone deserves an opinion not

159
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,600
everyone deserves a say and here's what

160
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,960
I mean by that there are certain things

161
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,400
in life that I simply do not know I've

162
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,900
not done the research I don't have any

163
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,699
life experience and one of my favorite

164
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,440
things when someone asks me my opinion

165
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,419
on something that I'm just not very well

166
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,280
educated on I haven't really given much

167
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:19,020
thought or time or attention to it I

168
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,639
just love being able to say I'll be

169
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,560
honest I don't really have an opinion on

170
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,180
that or I just say I can't really make

171
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,380
an informed judgment on that so what I

172
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,940
mean by this is I believe everyone

173
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,979
deserves an opinion everyone can have an

174
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,080
opinion but not everyone deserves to say

175
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:33,720
it and you need to understand that this

176
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,699
applies to your parents to your friends

177
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,520
to maybe sometimes even in your business

178
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:40,080
I will always always take the opinion of

179
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,460
everyone in my business but some people

180
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,680
they deserve an opinion but they don't

181
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,539
deserve a say and I don't mean that to

182
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,740
belittle anyone because there's areas of

183
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,720
my life where I should definitely be a

184
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,639
louder opinion but maybe I don't really

185
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,740
deserve a say because I just I don't

186
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,479
have enough experience in that to really

187
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,039
bring anything meaningful to the table

188
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,199
so just remember this next time you're

189
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,360
letting other people's judgments Cloud

190
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,740
that inner direction that you know you

191
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,180
have because a lot of people around you

192
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,919
will give you their opinion you know

193
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,660
your friends your family all this and

194
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,979
let them have their opinions but they

195
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,419
shouldn't have a say in how your life

196
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,860
goes because who are they to tell you

197
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:12,780
unless it's someone who's extremely

198
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,979
successful of what you've done then yeah

199
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,539
they should probably have a bit of a say

200
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:17,759
in what's going on so from day one

201
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:20,160
always distinguish what is an opinion

202
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,500
and what is good advice those two things

203
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,240
are very different this third success

204
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,740
secret of the top one percent is once

205
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,080
they make money and especially when they

206
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,340
make money in a bulk amount because a

207
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,380
lot of people you know maybe they sell

208
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,000
their company maybe they have you know a

209
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,220
massive month in their business maybe

210
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,139
they sign a big contract unless they get

211
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,699
a big sum of money in they go and buy

212
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,620
assets and the reason that is is

213
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:42,720
especially in your first I would say

214
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,780
really even your first 10 to 20 years in

215
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,580
business or in your career you are a

216
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,960
massive liability to yourself if you

217
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,419
make a lot of money there's a high

218
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,800
chance a high probability that you will

219
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,240
spend it or maybe you have a rough

220
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,340
period in your life or maybe you just

221
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,020
have a core life or a midlife crisis I

222
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,819
mean these things happen so instead of

223
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,979
having all this cash instead when you

224
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:04,500
get a big lump sum of cash and go buy

225
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:06,240
assets go buy assets and go buy good

226
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,800
quality things that are a little

227
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,120
difficult to sell because the other

228
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,460
thing go invest a percentage of your

229
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,660
portfolio into stocks into crypto sure

230
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,460
do these things but at the end of the

231
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,960
day it's just one click of a button and

232
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,880
you can sell it whereas when you're

233
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,440
buying things like physical gold when

234
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,880
you're buying things like houses even

235
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,800
later down the line like I've been doing

236
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,360
a lot of in the last couple years buying

237
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,400
equity in businesses these aren't things

238
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,660
that you can just sell easily so once

239
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,220
you start making good amounts of money

240
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,380
just remember you will be the biggest

241
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,300
liability to yourself just remember that

242
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,099
you have a long career ahead of you and

243
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,780
there's always time to buy the Glamorous

244
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,460
things that you want and do this and do

245
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,440
that and you can do those things but

246
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,240
first go buy some assets go get that

247
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,460
money away from you now the next success

248
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,380
secret is do what's practical not what's

249
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,360
sexy the most successful people I've met

250
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:51,120
they haven't made their money by having

251
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,280
a you know an activewear brand or by

252
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,620
building this super complicated product

253
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,300
that took 73 million dollars in

254
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,180
investment to go off the ground no most

255
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,220
of them make money in really boring ways

256
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,440
really old traditional B2B Services

257
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,539
building software and then licensing it

258
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,699
out to Big corporations Import and

259
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:10,860
Export Logistics

260
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,479
Timber like honestly the richest people

261
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,819
I've met they don't do things that are

262
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,380
like that billion dollar unicorn company

263
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,360
they just find areas in the market where

264
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,680
there's inefficiencies or where they can

265
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,720
just do something even three percent

266
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,220
better and because of that they get more

267
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,139
of the market shares so yeah really what

268
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,639
it comes down to is don't think that you

269
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,960
need to build a billion dollar unicorn

270
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,539
company just understand that there's

271
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,979
money literally all around you and it

272
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:33,959
doesn't need to be as sexy as you think

273
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:35,520
it does the next success secret is that

274
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:37,260
the morning sets the tone for the rest

275
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,700
of the day I have friends of mine that

276
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,279
are multi-billionaires and some of them

277
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,680
wake up at 10 am and some of them wake

278
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,480
up at 6am and they're equally as

279
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,040
successful because I have friends of

280
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,779
mine that work in different time zones

281
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,339
so for them to wake up at 10 A.M makes

282
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,560
more sense and I have friends that have

283
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,240
physical offices and only work in one

284
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,620
country so they don't really need to

285
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,080
think about time zones so for them it's

286
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,880
nice to wake up at 6am wake up get a

287
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,860
training session in be in the office by

288
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,920
eight or nine so just understand this

289
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,540
whole like 5 a.m 4 a.m like you

290
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,920
don't need to wake up early necessarily

291
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,959
to be successful you just need to wake

292
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,459
up at a time that makes the most sense

293
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,080
for you and that can be different for

294
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:15,240
different people I personally wake up at

295
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,860
8am back when I used to live in London

296
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,440
you know five years ago I used to wake

297
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,880
up at 5 30 in the morning that worked

298
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,500
for me for a while until I realized that

299
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,420
like actually I'm not really a morning

300
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,519
person and then I stuck to 6 30 because

301
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,899
6 30 I wake up my personal trainer would

302
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,700
be at my house would be at the gym by

303
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:31,200
seven o'clock and that worked for me for

304
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,300
a few years and then now since I moved

305
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,120
to Dubai I have 150 employees and most

306
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,640
of my employees are in America or UK so

307
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,440
you know now eight sometimes even 8 30

308
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,240
that works a little better for me so

309
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,220
it's not about the time that you wake up

310
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,200
instead it's about having a set morning

311
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,820
routine a set thing that you do every

312
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,519
single morning and just understanding

313
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,620
that you can't crawl out of bed eat a

314
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,560
high sugar breakfast scroll on your

315
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,240
phone watch some YouTube and think that

316
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,700
that's going to be an impactful way to

317
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,040
start your day for me I wake up I wash

318
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,600
my face I get direct sunlight and do a

319
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,160
bit of stretching and warming up for 30

320
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,720
minutes and then I train for like an

321
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,339
hour and a half have some breakfast and

322
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,380
get to work and that's my schedule here

323
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,820
at my home sometimes when I'm traveling

324
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,440
and I'm not training as intensely

325
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,360
sometimes my morning routine will be

326
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,620
wake up have a coffee and get straight

327
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,800
to work it doesn't need to be anything

328
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:22,260
super crazy or 17 different steps the

329
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,060
next thing is the less you talk the more

330
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,519
they listen there's a lot of people out

331
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,500
here that spill too many secrets that in

332
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,940
negotiations are the first one to say

333
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,200
the price you should never ever be the

334
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,360
first one to say the price when you're

335
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,980
negotiating a deal and just in general

336
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,500
get themselves in way too much trouble

337
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,420
by talking too much so just remember the

338
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,519
less you talk the less mistakes you're

339
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,740
gonna make in sort of high stress

340
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,200
situations and usually the less you talk

341
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,760
the more other people listen and it's

342
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,160
just been my personal observation that

343
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,899
the most successful people I know they

344
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,300
usually don't talk too much they would

345
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,560
rather listen they'd rather analyze a

346
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,160
room and it's not always from this

347
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,779
Machiavellian you know trying to win a

348
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,279
war type thing a lot of times they're

349
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:04,200
just listening because they actually

350
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,940
want to get other people's opinions they

351
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,500
want to be questioned they want to get a

352
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,579
new perspective so just remember the

353
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,680
less you talk

354
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:12,720
the more they listen the next thing is

355
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,640
pick the right opportunity at the right

356
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,200
time and so many people have issues with

357
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,899
this and I feel like YouTube and social

358
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,519
media is a very uh terrible place for

359
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:22,079
this as well because one thing I see a

360
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,300
lot is people say don't do what someone

361
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,339
says do what they do or something along

362
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,019
those lines do you realize how stupid

363
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:29,279
that is because here's the thing if

364
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,480
let's say someone has been in an

365
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,579
industry for 10 years and they're

366
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,260
telling you hey if I was starting out I

367
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:36,360
would do this are you gonna be stupid

368
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,399
enough to think that you starting from

369
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,399
square one can do what someone else is

370
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,279
doing after 10 years in the industry no

371
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,019
don't be silly everything in life is

372
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,880
about doing things in the right order

373
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:50,040
it's not always about doing the right

374
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,079
thing it's about doing it in the right

375
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,240
order so just understand the things you

376
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,579
do today are nowhere near as impressive

377
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,700
as what you can do in three years ten

378
00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:01,200
years 30 years in 30 years if you do

379
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,820
business right and if you have a good

380
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,620
career you should be able to make a

381
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,940
phone call and that same evening have

382
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,100
five million dollars in your bank

383
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,860
account just simply based off of

384
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,779
Goodwill and your reputation you can't

385
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,700
do that now in 30 years you should

386
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:16,440
probably be able to sell a hundred

387
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,300
thousand dollars a million dollars five

388
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,640
million dollars worth of a product or a

389
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,620
service before you even create it just

390
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,360
because you have so many loyal customers

391
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,120
over the years that understand whatever

392
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,220
you put out is quality so I wanted even

393
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,200
if it's not available yet you can't do

394
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,120
that right now there's businesses in 30

395
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,279
years that will cost you

396
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,839
four million dollars to start and in the

397
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,100
first year they're gonna break even but

398
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,660
within five years of running the company

399
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,880
it'll be a 40 million dollar a year

400
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,200
company but just remember you needed

401
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,060
that four million dollars to start in

402
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,220
the first place so you don't have that

403
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,660
so don't look at what someone else is

404
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,100
doing let's say you're a real estate

405
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,380
agent don't look at what a real estate

406
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,240
agent is doing in their 15th year as

407
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,579
being a real estate agent no look at

408
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,620
what they did when they first started so

409
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:00,959
pick the right opportunity at the right

410
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,420
time at what I call the correct point

411
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,459
when it comes to your career timing the

412
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,540
next thing is discipline over motivation

413
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:08,100
listen if you're going to become

414
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,120
successful most of the time you're not

415
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,519
going to be motivated to do it

416
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,660
motivation is kind of like Runners High

417
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,860
when you're running when you're running

418
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,320
a marathon you're only going to get

419
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,579
Runners high for some of it for a very

420
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,079
small portion you're gonna get that

421
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:21,360
feeling where you're running on clouds

422
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:22,860
and you've got this intrinsic energy and

423
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,540
all this stuff that's a very small

424
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,880
portion when you lose that feeling of

425
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,320
Runners High what you just give up on

426
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,120
the marathon no you just need to have

427
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,260
discipline you need to lock in and you

428
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,880
need to do it whether you feel like

429
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,579
you're not and that's the way having

430
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,380
this successful career is motivation is

431
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:39,360
great sometimes you're gonna get it but

432
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,339
it's fleeting you need to rely on

433
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,200
discipline instead the next success

434
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:45,019
secret of what I've observed and

435
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,779
witnessed from my wealthiest of friends

436
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:50,399
is they bought A1 assets as early as

437
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,660
they could in their career and they held

438
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,980
on to them a lot of these people have

439
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:57,540
property in London New York Paris La you

440
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,060
name it and they've had these properties

441
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,440
for 10 20 years and they've held on to

442
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,480
them and it's not just properties I'm

443
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,339
talking license plates I'm talking

444
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,720
hotels and I understand it's going to

445
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:08,040
take a bit of money to buy these things

446
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,660
so of course you've got to focus on

447
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,940
having a good career first but once you

448
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,500
have a good career buy these A1 assets

449
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,820
which aren't the most exciting

450
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,920
Investments you know you're not going to

451
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,300
make the craziest returns but you're

452
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,500
never going to lose money and it's stuff

453
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,360
that you can have throughout generations

454
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,220
and I know it's not important right now

455
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,480
but later down the line and it's one of

456
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,980
the next points that I will talk about

457
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,940
so in 20 years when you want to buy

458
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,380
something let's say you want to buy a

459
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,940
jet you're not going to be spending 20

460
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,560
million dollars on a jet no you're going

461
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,120
to put four million dollars down in the

462
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,380
other 60 million dollars the bank has

463
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,019
going to give you and when you have

464
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:39,420
incredible A1 Assets in your portfolio

465
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:41,220
stuff that isn't the highest returns but

466
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,660
there's basically zero risk the banks

467
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,579
will have absolutely zero issue giving

468
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,860
you money the next success secret is

469
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:48,660
that if you sleep on a win you're gonna

470
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,120
wake up with a loss and what I mean by

471
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,940
that is just because you won does not

472
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,740
make you a winner winning is a

473
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,959
continuous process I see a lot of people

474
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,339
in their teens in their early 20s and

475
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:01,079
I'd say this is probably the biggest

476
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,180
reason I'm in the position that I am is

477
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:05,639
because I made my first million dollars

478
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,680
cash at 18. but a lot of people in that

479
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,060
situation they buy their Lambo or lease

480
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,160
it or whatever they get a nice apartment

481
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:14,100
and then they're King of the castle

482
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,839
they're a winner and they had their win

483
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,639
and they're happy with that or they go

484
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,139
to bed with a win they hibernate with a

485
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,519
win and then they wake up a few months

486
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:23,339
later with a loss you need to understand

487
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,959
that it is so much harder to keep it and

488
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,820
multiply it than it is to get it getting

489
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,100
it is one thing so of course celebrate

490
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,120
your wins celebrate the times when you

491
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,380
said you were going to do something and

492
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,880
you stuck to your word but just

493
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,220
understand that if you stay in that

494
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,899
place if you keep revisiting the past

495
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,760
then the future is not going to look

496
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:40,320
very pretty for you now the next success

497
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,480
secret and I kind of alluded to this

498
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,459
earlier is build good relationships with

499
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,839
the banks from early on and the reason I

500
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:47,760
say build good relationships with the

501
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,399
banks early on is for a couple reasons

502
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,139
number one as much as I hate banks at

503
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,839
some point you will need them if you do

504
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:56,519
want to creatively Finance some of your

505
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,160
assets whether you want to creatively

506
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,420
finance a business acquisition you know

507
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,620
you want to buy equity in a new business

508
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,899
you want to start a new business you

509
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,579
name it banks are very useful and the

510
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,839
other thing is when it comes to making a

511
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:08,760
lot of money I know some of you guys are

512
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,500
literally sitting at home in your mom's

513
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,880
basement and you're going why do I need

514
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,860
to think about or start worrying about

515
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,180
you know me making so much money that I

516
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,680
need good banks on my side that aren't

517
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,300
going to give me troubles yeah listen

518
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,560
maybe this month you're not going to

519
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,060
make good money maybe next year you're

520
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,199
not going to make good money hey maybe

521
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,760
you're not going to make good money for

522
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,139
10 years but they will get to a point if

523
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,420
you keep working that you make enough

524
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:29,459
money that it raises normal Banks

525
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,260
eyebrows just normal banking eyebrows

526
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:32,579
and that's where premium banking is a

527
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,440
step above and then eventually you start

528
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:35,820
getting into some private Banks and then

529
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,139
it's a matter of where do you have your

530
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,940
private banking and stuff like that but

531
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:40,800
the point is from the age of 14 I

532
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,839
started reading Finance books I started

533
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,060
to understand how the world of banking

534
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:47,040
and finance works and I didn't need that

535
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,139
yet but at least I was aware and I knew

536
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,579
that hey once I have a lot of money I

537
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:52,620
need to be able to have good banking on

538
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:54,839
my side and by the way all of my assets

539
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,699
I don't have uh financing I don't have a

540
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,920
mortgage on any of my properties I don't

541
00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:00,300
owe any Bank any money but it's good to

542
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,339
know that if I need 10 million dollars

543
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,020
by next week I have it there if I need

544
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,400
it it's good to know that when I need to

545
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,199
send a wire for a few million dollars

546
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,760
they don't give me headaches because if

547
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,660
you're dealing with normal banking good

548
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,400
luck they're gonna think you're a

549
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,319
criminal even if you've been in the

550
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,480
cleanest businesses and you have years

551
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:17,880
and years of track record

552
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,020
it's normal banking they want to make

553
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,280
your life as difficult as humanly

554
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,600
possible so at least if you can just

555
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,980
start thinking about these things from a

556
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,419
young age you don't need to apply it but

557
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,860
I just want to prepare you for it in the

558
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:28,260
same way I've prepared for it 10 years

559
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,880
ago well before I even made my money the

560
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,980
next success secret is keep your circle

561
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,179
small listen you can have a lot of

562
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,500
acquaintances you can have a lot of

563
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:37,140
business associates a lot of people can

564
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,640
know who you are but in terms of your

565
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,500
actual Circle the people that you will

566
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,539
tell things to the people that you will

567
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,580
confide in you have to keep that Circle

568
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:46,140
small because there's only a few select

569
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,940
amount of people that can keep up with

570
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,080
your pace with a pace that you're moving

571
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,400
forward and you're evolving in life

572
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,140
there's only a few select amount of

573
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,140
people that can keep up with it and the

574
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,179
other thing is loose lips sink ships the

575
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,100
more that you tell people things the

576
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:00,660
more loose ends that you're creating and

577
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,280
the more chances for that to come back

578
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,419
and bite you listen it doesn't matter

579
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,700
what you've done in life whether you've

580
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,500
lived the holiest of holy life or the

581
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,940
most sinful of life people shouldn't

582
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,320
know your private business your private

583
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,299
business should remain private to you

584
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,980
and when you keep your circle small you

585
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,240
know that it's safe whereas you know if

586
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,100
you want to be the person who's buddy

587
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,900
buddy with everyone and as I said be

588
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,580
play be friendly hey Network do whatever

589
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,320
you want to do but I'm talking don't be

590
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,640
the person that meets someone and in the

591
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,020
first or second dinner you know you're

592
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,760
telling them your deepest darkest

593
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,320
secrets and all this stuff because my

594
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,480
rule of things is I will never tell

595
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,520
someone outside of my inner circle you

596
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,080
know my trusted confidence I will never

597
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,820
tell someone something

598
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,919
that I wouldn't want other people to

599
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,480
know so if I tell someone something I

600
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,860
know full well unless they're in that

601
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,480
little small Inner Circle that I have

602
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,460
that they're gonna tell other people and

603
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,020
even if they don't tell other people at

604
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,580
least I mentally prepare myself for it

605
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,200
and that gives me a good filter of what

606
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,900
do I tell people and what do I not so

607
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,419
just remember keep your circle small and

608
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,700
keep your circle solid the next success

609
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:59,039
secret to talk one percent is radical

610
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,020
responsibility your marriage failed your

611
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,000
fault your business failed your fault

612
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,919
you know you got a knee injury the man

613
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,780
you couldn't uh play tennis for six

614
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,460
months your fault whatever it is it's

615
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,440
your fault because that is the only way

616
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,360
to properly look at your life and

617
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,299
analyze what are the inputs that could

618
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,679
have led to this final outcome you know

619
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:18,840
whereas if you just blame it on

620
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,760
externals and all this you're not going

621
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,580
to get very far in life the next success

622
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,440
secret is work like your new money but

623
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,360
act like you're old money and have the

624
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,520
values of old money from our early age

625
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,919
all I wanted to do was dress like old

626
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,100
money have financial literacy like old

627
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,740
money have old money principles values

628
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,840
and bear in mind I'm 23. I'm not perfect

629
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,220
I still show aspects to my life and I

630
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,320
still talk about money in a way that

631
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,760
probably you know the old money crowds

632
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,200
would hate but that's also just because

633
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,640
you know I've been uploading YouTube

634
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,260
videos for eight years I talked about

635
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,360
things openly and honestly when I was

636
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:54,419
broke and I talk about things openly and

637
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,700
honestly now that I've been able to have

638
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:57,960
a decent amount of financial success in

639
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,940
my life so just remember you want to

640
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,380
have that hunger of new money you know

641
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,000
old money they don't have that same sort

642
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,740
of hunger but what old money has is

643
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,840
wisdom so if you can match up that

644
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,000
hunger that drive that pushes you

645
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,100
forward but then have the wisdom and

646
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,020
always learn from old money then that

647
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,460
will be your secret to not only making a

648
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,559
lot of money but making sure that you

649
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,059
don't lose it once you get it the next

650
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,860
success secret and this may be a little

651
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:22,559
controversial is that you are not going

652
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,660
to change the world but you can make it

653
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,919
slightly better I'm so sick and tired of

654
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,020
these people who are like I'm Gonna

655
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,880
Change the World you know I'll give you

656
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:32,100
a perfect example I listen maybe some

657
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,320
people have different opinions I'm just

658
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,960
this is just my opinion Apple did not

659
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,120
the world because here's the thing I

660
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,760
love my iPhone I love my Apple ecosystem

661
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,200
but if Apple didn't exist I guarantee

662
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,000
you I would be more than happy with

663
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,620
Samsung there will be no void missing in

664
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,120
my life there'd be no you know my life

665
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,280
wouldn't be in shatters I would get used

666
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,840
to Samsung very very quickly all this

667
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,220
stuff so as a company realistically

668
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,080
you're not going to change the world but

669
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,660
you can make things slightly better and

670
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,700
that's the beauty of it for me I I just

671
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,679
love people that have things in their

672
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,880
life that don't seem like that big you

673
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,860
know for example a lot of these Japanese

674
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,140
sushi chefs you know you're not changing

675
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,480
anyone's life by sourcing the right Tuna

676
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,940
on the right day and spending 60 years

677
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,620
or 40 years in apprenticeship and

678
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,660
learning and practicing how to make the

679
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,100
right sticky rice and how to sharpen

680
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,900
your knife in the right way and how to

681
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,940
cut the fish at the right angle you're

682
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,860
not changing anyone's life but you are

683
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,020
making the world slightly better because

684
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,600
whatever it is that you're doing however

685
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,640
insignificant it may seem to you just do

686
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,380
it the best that you can and then that's

687
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,240
when the world changes when we all

688
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,340
rather than trying to be this Larger

689
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,559
than Life person of like like I'm Gonna

690
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,600
Change the World that to me that's

691
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:41,580
just so grandiose and self-absorbed just

692
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,260
realize listen whatever I'm doing I want

693
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,000
to be the best at it and I want to put

694
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,460
out the best service the best product I

695
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,659
want to put a smile on people's face I

696
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,280
don't care if I'm a waiter I want to be

697
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:51,600
the best waiter out there and you're not

698
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,039
going to change the world by doing that

699
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,960
but you'll make the world a better place

700
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,820
and if we all do that that's how we

701
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,440
change the world the next success secret

702
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,299
is that private victories lead to public

703
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,679
victories and you need to understand

704
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:03,299
this you need to understand that when

705
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,620
you see someone who gets on their jet or

706
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:06,900
they drive their Rolls Royce or whatever

707
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,520
it is there were so many private

708
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,380
victories that went into it just

709
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,120
understand the bigger the public Victory

710
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,380
the more private victories that went

711
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,240
into it you know for someone to go out

712
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,220
there and buy a Gucci or Balenciaga

713
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,659
hoodie they probably didn't need to have

714
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,799
that many private victories they

715
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:22,020
probably didn't need to have that many

716
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:23,760
years of just sacrificing putting your

717
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,679
head down discipline doing things that

718
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,299
you don't want to do because you have to

719
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,919
do it it really didn't take that many

720
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:30,659
private victories to create that public

721
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,760
Victory but for someone to buy a 60

722
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:34,980
million dollar jet you bet your ass

723
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,240
there was so many private victory you

724
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,860
will never comprehend you will never

725
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,900
understand you better ask them when a

726
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:42,299
boxer wins a boxing match at the highest

727
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,159
level that's cool but you know how many

728
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:46,020
private victories went into that how

729
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,900
much people don't see so just

730
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:51,120
understand whatever you want in life the

731
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,380
bigger the public Victory the more

732
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,299
private victories are going to need to

733
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,860
go into it and last and final success

734
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:58,620
secret of the top one percent is that

735
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:00,480
after 10 years of doing One Singular

736
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,000
thing it will start to look effortless

737
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,340
and I think sometimes people look at

738
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,260
someone's career or how good someone is

739
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,640
at something and they go I could never

740
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,039
do that they just make it look so

741
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,500
effortless they make it look so easy of

742
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,360
course when you work that hard it starts

743
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,039
to look easy it starts to look elegant

744
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,039
and you really start to have that effect

745
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,659
after 10 years onwards when someone has

746
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:24,299
been doing something for 10 years plus

747
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:25,919
it will start to look effortless and

748
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:27,419
just understand that shouldn't scare you

749
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,500
when you first start that's a part of

750
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:31,200
their process they had to go through

751
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,580
that process of things being clunky and

752
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,700
them being bad at things and they have

753
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:37,260
to do it so many years a decade plus and

754
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,360
then it starts to look effortless and

755
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,039
eventually when you find something that

756
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,539

757
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,520

00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,780
good at this thing even if I wake up

760
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:51,120
with zero motivation for it or not when

761
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,679
