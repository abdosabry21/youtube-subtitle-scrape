1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
ladies and gentlemen in today's video

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,299
I'm going to reveal to you the Sure Fire

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:09,179
guaranteed way to make your first

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,780
million in the next five to ten years if

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,480
right now you're a broke student this is

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,820
genuinely 99

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,880
guaranteed to make you rich if you watch

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,680
the entire video and really take in what

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,199
I'm trying to tell you here and listen

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,240
I'm coming up to my 10th year as an

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,820
entrepreneur I have seen everything and

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,520
I have over a dozen companies that I

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,460
personally own or my holding company has

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,140
Equity stakes in so I've kind of seen it

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,260
all and I can tell you for a fact that

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,239
this is pretty much the most Surefire

17
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,600
route but as I said if you watch this

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,820
video If you truly take it in and if you

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,399
truly apply what I'm about to tell you

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,160
now listen times have changed and the

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,260
world is extremely different to what it

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,379
was like a hundred years ago that said

23
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,480
some business principles are Timeless

24
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,100
now a hundred years ago if you wanted to

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,260
get rich quickly and by the way when I

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,060
say quick most people think quick means

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,479
two months or five months I'm talking

28
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,460
quick in the normal world is hey I made

29
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,560
the intention that I am going to go from

30
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,960
nothing to something go from having

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,240
average income to becoming a millionaire

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,920
quick is five to ten years it's not five

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,420
to ten months normally a hundred years

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,100
ago even right now if you want to become

35
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,479
a millionaire you know from the point in

36
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,700
which you get your degree it'll take you

37
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,979
20 30 years so trust me when I say five

38
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,780
to ten years that is a good timeline now

39
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,580
I say five to ten but it will probably

40
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,380
be a lot quicker for you but getting

41
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,299
back to my point 100 years ago the way

42
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,520
you would do it is you would either be

43
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,860
an employee at a fast growing company

44
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,560
and bring so much value to the company

45
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,659
that they just can't help themselves but

46
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,820
now obviously you need to continue to

47
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,979
make your value known and renegotiate

48
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,420
with your company and just say hey I

49
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,380
know what I'm bringing to the table so

50
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,299
make sure that I'm getting paid

51
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,259
adequately so that's the first route but

52
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,840
that's not really what I want to talk

53
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,600
about here today the second route is you

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,820
work inside of a fast-growing company a

55
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,740
company where you can learn a lot and

56
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,960
you work in that company for two years

57
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,520
three years four years five years and

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,560
then you take everything that you've

59
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,500
learned and you go and you start your

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,599
own business in a similar industry and

61
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,760
from there you add in hard work and you

62
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,440
absolutely take off and you may even

63
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,819
bring in one percent the amount of

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,440
business that the company used to work

65
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,180
for but that's fine because you have a

66
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,160
hundred percent ownership now as I said

67
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,260
100 years ago 200 years ago 300 years

68
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,239
ago this would have been the path the

69
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,640
path would have always started with you

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,620
working at a company or an organization

71
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,440
and understanding that in your early

72
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,780
years you need to prioritize learning

73
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,160
over earning earning can come a little

74
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,260
later but in your early years I'm

75
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,420
talking specifically here as a student

76
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,239
as a teenager someone in your early

77
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,340
early 20s learning should always be the

78
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,440
priority now before I get into real meat

79
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,660
of this video on the topic of learning

80
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,760
so many of you guys ask very business

81
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,920
specific questions or questions that are

82
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,239
specific to your situation and

83
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,980
unfortunately on YouTube I just can't

84
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,080
really answer them so that's why earlier

85
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,480
this year I started an Instagram called

86
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,580
talk with Iman on there I try to do q

87
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,500
and A's once a week I'm gonna be honest

88
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,940
sometimes I get busy so it's not weekly

89
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,280
sometimes it's two or three times a

90
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,780
month but I try my best so I do free q

91
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,060
and A's on there and every once in a

92
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,260
while I will also do a live q a and just

93
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,360
answer some of your guys's questions

94
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,940
live so you can just type on your phone

95
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,459
talk with Iman follow the account and I

96
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,620
will try to answer your question on the

97
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,239
next q a that I do but getting back to

98
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,099
the main point here the reason I wanted

99
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,900
to talk about 100 years ago is I want to

100
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:36,300
explain really what I'm seeing right now

101
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,940
in society and why that is keeping you

102
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,799
poor that's keeping you dumb and it's

103
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,560
keeping you stuck you see the issue is

104
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,780
in modern society everyone is in such a

105
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,159
rush to become a millionaire and the

106
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,319
reason they're in such a rush is because

107
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,879
of the things that they think it will

108
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,280
give them and by the way I'm

109
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,260
specifically speaking to the teenagers

110
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,000
and the students here you've got kids

111
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,019
who are 16 who are in such a rush to

112
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,040
become a millionaire because I know

113
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,540
exactly what they're thinking they're

114
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,220
thinking hey once I'm a millionaire I'm

115
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,420
gonna get all the girls or people are

116
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,739
going to be impressed and I'm going to

117
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,239
be able to buy these things and I'm

118
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,040
going to talk to you very frankly as

119
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,220
someone who made their first million

120
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,799
dollars in cash in the bank at the age

121
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,380
of 18. I'm going to tell you this right

122
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,120
here right now when you make money at an

123
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,940
early age and I'm not talking early like

124
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,520
25 or 27 28 because that's still earlier

125
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:27,419
or maybe even 23 or 24. I'm talking

126
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,759
early as in 18 21. no one is impressed

127
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:31,020
they just think you are a lucky kid I

128
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,520
can tell you this because I experienced

129
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,780
this very few people thought he was a

130
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,800
genius they're like oh he got lucky at

131
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,479
an early age and he's probably gonna

132
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,759
lose all of it because honestly that's

133
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,740
what happens 98 of the time so that's

134
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,600
number one and number two girls don't

135
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,500
want you at that age either you have

136
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,720
someone like your high school Suite

137
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,740
heart who loves you no matter what so it

138
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,740
doesn't matter if you make your first

139
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,120
million at 18 or a 28 this girl's in it

140
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,979
for the long run or if you're trying to

141
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,540
pick up new girls they're more concerned

142
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,919
with like the 28 year olds the 30 year

143
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,900
olds the sort of girls that you think

144
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,419
money is gonna attract they don't want a

145
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,340
guy who's 18 or 21. so the reason I make

146
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:05,220
that clear is because everyone who's 16

147
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,900
18 20 is in such a rush you know let me

148
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,820
make my first million let me make my

149
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,259
first million and it's so stupid because

150
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,720
they would rather make their first

151
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,280
million in something that is pretty much

152
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,780
just luck let me let me give you an

153
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,259
example they would rather make their

154
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,360
first million at 18 or 19 or 20 by some

155
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:22,800
lucky crypto pick you know they put a

156
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,880
thousand dollars into one coin and

157
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,380
then it turned into a million dollars

158
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,900
let me tell you something that will ruin

159
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,340
your life forever because first of all

160
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,900
making a good amount of money at a young

161
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,300
age is already a massive challenge

162
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,979
what's even worse is if you got lucky

163
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,840
and let's call it what it is and that is

164
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,880
luck and by the way I've made a crap ton

165
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,620
of money with crypto but I never thought

166
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,639
that was me being a genius I just knew

167
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,440
hey there's a small part of my

168
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,060
Investment Portfolio and cool in two

169
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,380
years I made almost 10 million dollars

170
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,280
from crypto but that wasn't my career

171
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,900
and let me tell you something if that

172
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,100
was my career I would be very depressed

173
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,020
right now considering everything that's

174
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,639
going on in the crypto markets and if I

175
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,960
didn't get out at the right time and all

176
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,060
of this stuff but for me I was always

177
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,560
very chill about it because I planted my

178
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,600
seeds I've been an entrepreneur for 10

179
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,860
years I have all of these businesses so

180
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,479
I know that I'm going a little bit side

181
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,280
tangent here but that's all to say that

182
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,039
the best time truly I can tell you the

183
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,560
best time in my opinion to make money is

184
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,660
from the age of 25 to 30. now I happen

185
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,860
to make money a lot younger but also

186
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,419
bear in mind I started my first

187
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,800
entrepreneurial Adventure when I was 14.

188
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:21,060
so 14 15 16 17 18 five years it took me

189
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,100
five years to make my first million

190
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,479
remember what I told you earlier on I

191
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,819
said five to ten years to make your

192
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,560
first million what happened to me five

193
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,720
years so I'm talking and I'm telling you

194
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,460
guys from experience so going back to my

195
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,620
main point the trajectory whether it's

196
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,120
now or 100 years ago I believe that if

197
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,460
you are young and when I say young I

198
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,680
mean really below the age of 23 the

199
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,440
trajectory has always been very clear

200
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,300
first you are an apprentice you are

201
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,520
sponge you're learning as much as you

202
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,440
can you're absorbing everything and then

203
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,000
you can become the master now let me

204
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,580
tell you something these days we rarely

205
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,840
have apprenticeships we have internships

206
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,400
and there's a big difference when you're

207
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,600
an intern when you're an intern in a big

208
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,919
company I've even had friends of mine

209
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,479
especially when I was younger you know

210
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,100
friends of mine that were my age you

211
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,600
know obviously you know for me by the

212
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,800
age of 21 I was making millions and

213
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,900
millions of dollars a year but my

214
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,100
friends that I grew up with were looking

215
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,419
at internships and they were telling me

216
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,039
Oh you know what internship do you

217
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,720
recommend and this and that and I had to

218
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,160
tell them very honestly I said listen if

219
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,440
you go to a company that's more than 200

220
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,639
employees you're gonna be lost No One's

221
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,560
Gonna train you you're not gonna really

222
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,180
learn anything but if you look back 200

223
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,160
years ago let's say you were even a

224
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,720
locksmith you would be an apprentice you

225
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,340
would be young and you'll be studying

226
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,860
the craft and even in places like Japan

227
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,479
this stuff still goes on you're young

228
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,520
and you work for a company that's not

229
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,500
massive not too big where you get lost

230
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,180
and you learn things and you get to see

231
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,580
the back end and you get to see how a

232
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,620
master of their craft does something and

233
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,240
you get to take all of this in as a

234
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,160
sponge I mean it's the best thing you

235
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,979
could do for yourself at the age of 17

236
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,780
18 20 21 so just understand the

237
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:50,520
difference between an apprenticeship and

238
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,319
an internship really the difference is

239
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,699
this one you're going to get time

240
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,259
attention and you're going to get to

241
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,880
really learn the craft of this one

242
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,440
you're just thrown in with the dogs and

243
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,180
you have to fend for yourself no one is

244
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,880
really going to take the time and care

245
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,380
and attention to show you the ropes so I

246
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,240
really think that if you're 21 or

247
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,280
younger when you're making the decision

248
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,860
hey what's my next career move what's my

249
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,740
next step forget about how much you will

250
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,780
earn from it I want you instead to

251
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,400
evaluate how much are you going to learn

252
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,539
from it I want you to look at the thing

253
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,039
that you're going to learn and go hey

254
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,960
you know if I work at this company for

255
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:24,479
one or two years what skills will I

256
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,479
learn that will make me so much money

257
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,099
it's not even funny at the age of 35.

258
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,300
because listen if you can spend even two

259
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:32,399
to three years working at the right

260
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,200
company and working your way up through

261
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,419
the ranks you should then take that

262
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,880
experience and use that to launch pad

263
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,500
your own business when the time is right

264
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,419
and listen it's nothing personal with

265
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,520
your old company you should never breach

266
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,779
a confidential quality agreements you

267
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,700
should never be disrespectful to your

268
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:49,860
old company you should never step on

269
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,080
toes if that company made you who you

270
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,640
are but you take that knowledge you do

271
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,140
something different you offer something

272
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,940
different to the market you offer a

273
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,620
different service a different product or

274
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,120
maybe you even take that information and

275
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,100
partner up with someone and go into a

276
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,380
totally different industry but the point

277
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,880
is you take those skills that you have

278
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,920
learned and you understand and you

279
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,200
realize that this is the most valuable

280
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,300
asset that you have and you use that to

281
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,399
launch pad the next phase of your career

282
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,459
I don't think that people especially

283
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,040
young people truly understand how

284
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:22,440
important it is to get Insider knowledge

285
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,200
you need to get knowledge of the inner

286
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,360
workings of the business of the industry

287
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,640
now listen the quickest and easiest way

288
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,700
to do that is by investing in education

289
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:35,040
either investing in your own learning to

290
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,860
properly educate yourself or by getting

291
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,779
a coach mentoring guidance that is by

292
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,420
far the easiest and most effective way

293
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,860
now not everyone has funds for that I

294
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,320
understand some people are not position

295
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,120
so if you don't have funds for that the

296
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,100
best thing that you can do is go out

297
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,100
there associate yourself with a good

298
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,480
company work your ass off you also need

299
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,560
to learn work ethic because here's the

300
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,820
thing once you start working for

301
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,080
yourself or once you start having your

302
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,300
own business I remember what this was

303
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,000
like when I was 17. it's crazy I worked

304
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,800
so much on my company and then also

305
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,540
managing school at the same time but

306
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,459
when I was 17 I already had my company I

307
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,260
already even hired my first employee and

308
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:12,060
I dropped out of school and it was so

309
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,980
crazy for me to go from such a hectic

310
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,300
schedule to almost having the entire day

311
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,800
free and I actually became so

312
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,660
unproductive because I had too much time

313
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,100
I didn't even know what to do with it so

314
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,080
learning that work ethic and that

315
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,880
schedule is something that's also going

316
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,440
to be extremely valuable for you so as I

317
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,660
said associate yourself with the right

318
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,820
company and by the way the right company

319
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,500
doesn't mean the biggest company or the

320
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,180
company that makes the most money or the

321
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,100
company that even has the most prestige

322
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,500
but the company that is willing to

323
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,180
invest in you and the company that is

324
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,200
willing to give you the best training

325
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,060
and that you'll get the closest

326
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,380
proximity to whatever it is that you

327
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,720
want to learn now here's the thing there

328
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,920
are some companies that are too small

329
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,360
and you're really not actually going to

330
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,620
learn that much and those companies that

331
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,579
are too big that once again you're not

332
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,620
going to learn that much you want to

333
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:55,680
find that sweet spot of a company that's

334
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,420
not too too big I'd say anything 100 or

335
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,680
less you're still going to learn a lot

336
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,600
and by the way when you're looking to

337
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,160
join these companies even in the

338
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,600
interview process even while you're

339
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,399
trying to secure the job make it clear

340
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,839
that you care a lot less about money and

341
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,240
instead you care a lot more about

342
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,100
training and learning specific skills

343
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,360
and even asking the company hey is there

344
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,220
a budget you know in my companies

345
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,779
there's actually specific budgets for

346
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,579
training listen at some of my companies

347
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,620
I spent a hundred thousand dollars to

348
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:21,360
train one department on a specific thing

349
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,800
in other companies I spend thirty

350
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,420
thousand dollars for them to all meet up

351
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,220
three days and for them to Mastermind

352
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,200
about a specific problem we're facing

353
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,480
all the way down to small things at my

354
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,519
company every single person can buy as

355
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,959
many books as they want and the company

356
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,640
will pay for it that's just a rule I

357
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,440
have in my companies so whether it be

358
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,180
big or small you want to make sure that

359
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,339
the company is willing to invest in you

360
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,860
because for right now listen if you're

361
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:46,140
32 it's a different story it's a very

362
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,459
different story I'm not saying 32 you

363
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,140
know you should drop everything work for

364
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:50,519
free or work for very little and be an

365
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,019
apprentice no no you have very different

366
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,820
priorities at 32 you're in a very

367
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:56,519
different life phase I'm talking

368
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:59,040
specifically if you are 21 or younger

369
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,079
you have so much time it is ridiculous

370
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,720
but as I said in life you will not be

371
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:06,060
able to go far unless you have Insider

372
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,980
knowledge and this knowledge is behind a

373
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,079
wall and that wall means that you either

374
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,000
have to pay to play you have to pay to

375
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,800
actually learn this stuff or you join a

376
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,300
company and work through the ranks and

377
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,519
over the space of months and even years

378
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,480
you get this Insider information so

379
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,740
ladies and gentlemen I know that you

380
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,740
want me to come here and tell you that

381
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,360
there's a secret AI technology that

382
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,339
guarantees that you're going to become a

383
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,899
millionaire and all this BS that's not

384
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,920
the way it works listen the world has

385
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,360
changed of course it is the

386
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,740
opportunities have changed the way that

387
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,940
we conduct business all of these things

388
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,459
have changed but at the end of the day

389
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,440
there's still business principles that

390
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:39,060
are tried and tested and will always

391
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,620
remain and I don't care if it's 100

392
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,240
years ago I don't care if it's now or I

393
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,639
don't care if it's in 100 years from now

394
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,040
you can never ever ever go wrong by

395
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,200
being a teenager being an apprentice

396
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,420
soaking in as much information as you

397
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,399
have getting The Insider knowledge in an

398
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,560
industry and then a few years later when

399
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,120
you're ready use that to Launchpad and

400
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,339
start your own business start your own

401
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,519
idea start your own Venture and with

402
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,720

403
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,860
