1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,200
they do not want you to think too

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,810
[Music]

3
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:16,119
much you have better wake up and

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,039
understand that there are people who are

5
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:20,240
guiding your life and you don't even

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,240
know

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
it

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,000
the truth is you've been brainwashed and

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,440
this is how we got here you see it All

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,760
Began on the afternoon of January 15th

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,280
1902 a secretive meeting that changed

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,960
the course of history as we knew it was

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,120
about to take place in none other of

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,800
course than the Rockefeller townhouse in

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,399
Manhattan and the records state that a

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,719
middle-aged man walked into a meeting

17
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,199
room full of lawyers bureaucrats and in

18
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,399
the presence of one of his Clos CL

19
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,559
advisers sign the deed of trust that

20
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,200
formly established an organization that

21
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,960
would deeply impact the lives of

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,640
generations to come that man was John D

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,560
Rockefeller and his closest adviser a

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,080
particular man with a deep Connection in

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,200
Washington on that afternoon in 1902

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,280
they founded what would later be known

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,200
as the general education board an

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,479
organization whose goal was the

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,240
promotion of Education within the US

30
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,119
without distinction of race sex or Creed

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,640
which sounds like a very noble cause at

32
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,159
least that's what it looked like from

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,320
the surface you see the name and the

34
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,240
promise of the secret initiative well

35
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,560
they were very carefully chosen what

36
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,119
comes to your mind when you hear the

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,720
name general education board well it's

38
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,560
probably one of those dozen different

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,040
government initiatives that overview

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,439
education I mean surely that would be

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,360
part of the Department of Education

42
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,880
after all it is the government that

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,799
handles education

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,079
right wrong they came up with a name

45
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,159
that would make them look like an

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,159
official government organization but in

47
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,920
reality this board was not government at

48
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,719
all there were no government officials

49
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,239
on the board nor was it backed by the

50
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:11,319
government whatsoever its purpose one

51
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,480
thing and one thing only to

52
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:16,920
systematically infiltrate the education

53
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,840
system and promote its own secret agenda

54
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,239
and I'll reveal that secret agenda in

55
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,360
just a second but here's the most clever

56
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,680
part of this whole initiative its

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,599
promise and the name of it almost

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,879
pressured politicians into backing the

59
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,879
cause because going against the cause

60
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,760
with a name like that wouldn't look good

61
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:36,720
for any politicians in the public eyes

62
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,640
after all it was a cause for the less

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,879
favored people all in the name of

64
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,319
diversity and education and it worked

65
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,400
exactly as planned only one short year

66
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:48,560
later in 1903 the US Congress granted a

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,720
formal Charter to the board providing it

68
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,400
with a national mandate little did they

69
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,400
know that they had just set in motion

70
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,720
one of the biggest tails of mass control

71
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,280
and manipulation in the history of the

72
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,599
world the idea was simple to provide

73
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,599
free public education to every single

74
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,680
child in America that would create an

75
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,200
environment where every single person

76
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,760
would have access to the same

77
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,599
opportunities and would have a fair

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,280
start with real chances of achieving

79
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,200
success in Life or at least that was the

80
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,519
idea that they sold to the public fast

81
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:24,159
forward to today and here's where we're

82
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,680
at the people who built the schools were

83
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,480
consciously aiming at eradicating the

84
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,000
will of the students who were part of

85
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,680
the system because they wanted the to be

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,840
obedient now education at this point is

87
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,000
a racket I mean most people will never

88
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,519
recoup the cost of a college degree and

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,519
Harvard could afford to pay their

90
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,360
$50,000 a year tuition for their 6,000

91
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:48,920
students you know for how long not 10

92
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:52,599
years not 30 years not 50 years

93
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,480
120 years for free and not asking for

94
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,040
another

95
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,680
Penny over half of recent college

96
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,480
graduates are unemployed or undery

97
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,079
employed and the sole reason why

98
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,560
colleges are so expensive in the first

99
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:08,120
place is because of the loans themselves

100
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,439
that was their plan all along the

101
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,239
unpayable student debt the new wave of

102
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,959
wokeness invading the floors of

103
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,600
universities to Fortune 500 companies

104
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,400
the job crisis the bull corporate agenda

105
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,400
all of it was part of a much bigger plan

106
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,320
and a web of hidden interests spun over

107
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,080
the course of 300 plus years with one

108
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,960
single ultimate objective a ating the

109
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,000
Free Will of an entire generation and

110
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,800
turning you into a Mindless obedient

111
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,639
worker and those are just the tip of the

112
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,160
iceberg of my findings over the last few

113
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,919
months and it really all started with me

114
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,600
trying to figure out how this recent

115
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:48,080
woke culture invaded our society across

116
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,680
all the social media apps to the biggest

117
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,680
initiatives of the biggest investment

118
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,680
firms in the world but what I found was

119
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,400
a much bigger story here that's not

120
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,160
being told a very carefully crafted plan

121
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,840
A a plan that connected all of these

122
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,680
problems together a plan that has been

123
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,840
kept secret for a long time dating back

124
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,360
to over 250 years ago a plan that if

125
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,400
people were aware of the existence would

126
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,880
rock the foundations of the current

127
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,880
system and expose the side of the system

128
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,080
that is hidden in the shadows a plan

129
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,800
that is crafted by three notorious

130
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,160
individuals over the course of three

131
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,440
centuries and broken down into four

132
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,120
stages of social conditioning and how

133
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,400
you can Implement them to control the

134
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,600
masses as you wish all of it was laid

135
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,400
out in the pages of an old book that

136
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,840
started to be written in

137
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,220
1763 and you are about to see for the

138
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,880
first time what's in the pages of this

139
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:48,639
[Music]

140
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,280
book it all dates back to 1806 there was

141
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,880
one specific event that changed the

142
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,440
course of the world forever and it

143
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,720
created a Cascade effect that still

144
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,199
deeply affects us to this day back then

145
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,680
the territory in Europe that is known

146
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,039
today as Germany was a part of Prussia

147
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,840
now Prussia had somewhat of a fearsome

148
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,759
reputation as one of the most powerful

149
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,080
armies of Europe and they managed to

150
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,280
quickly expand from Germany and Conquer

151
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,960
territories of the current Day Poland

152
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,919
Denmark Belgium Lithuania Luxembourg and

153
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,919
even a big chunk of Russia now here's

154
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,360
where it gets interesting in 1806 that

155
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,440
was the year that the Prussian Empire

156
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,120
faced Napoleon's France during the

157
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,360
Napoleonic Wars and as you may know that

158
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,319
marked the fall of Berlin to the hands

159
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,520
of Napoleon meaning the supposedly

160
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,120
unbeatable Army Of Prussia Was Defeated

161
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,160
and that put the intellectuals of

162
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,599
Prussia in crisis mode I mean how could

163
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,160
such a better trained Army from the

164
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:50,240
feared Prussian Empire lose to

165
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,400
Napoleon's weaker forces they could not

166
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,520
digest the defeat of Prussia so the

167
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,440
intellectuals came to one conclusion the

168
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,720
reason as to why the Prussian Army Was

169
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,479
Defeated was because the Prussian

170
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,039
soldiers were Thinking by themselves in

171
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,720
the battlefield Napoleon soldiers on the

172
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,680
other hand were only following orders

173
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,440
soldiers thinking for themselves was so

174
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,160
deadly it costed Prussia an expensive

175
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,840
price you see they were forced to sign a

176
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,680
peace agreement they gave away about

177
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,840
half of their territory and they also

178
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,960
had to pay very Hefty indemnities to

179
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,560
France and support their army which of

180
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,919
course ended up creating a lot of

181
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,440
economic instability so they needed to

182
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,080
make sure that that would never happen

183
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,039
again and this is where the conditioning

184
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,960
Factor book started to be written you

185
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,800
see the prussians planned something that

186
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:40,080
was quite frankly ingenious evil but

187
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,280
ingenious you see the problem was clear

188
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,520
they needed soldiers who followed orders

189
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,639
and did as they were told without ever

190
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,800
questioning anything and what was the

191
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,759
way that the prussians found to do that

192
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,400
indoctrination so they created an 8-year

193
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,599
education system the sole purpose of it

194
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,879
to indoctrinate children and teach them

195
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,879
to obey comply and do as they're told

196
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,120
this newborn education system would

197
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,919
teach them to follow orders to comply

198
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,599
without questioning to respect the

199
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,599
authority of their superiors the

200
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:13,159
Prussian leaders would teach the kids

201
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:15,319
just enough so they could follow orders

202
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:17,360
and be useful to the ones to the top but

203
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,319
not too much that they started thinking

204
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,919
for themselves and I'm going to show you

205
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,919
exactly how this new system accomplished

206
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,919
that in chapter 3 now the system was

207
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:28,680
also the perfect solution to another

208
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:30,520
problem that the Prussian Empire had

209
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,919
been facing you see a few years earlier

210
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,320
the Prussian Empire had just invaded and

211
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:38,080
conquered a huge part of Poland which

212
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,279
was great but also created a massive

213
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,120
challenge how would they get the Polish

214
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:45,480
people to accept them as their rulers I

215
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,200
mean after all they were their enemies

216
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,800
they were the colonizers and now they

217
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,640
needed to get the very people they were

218
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,600
Waging War against to give up their

219
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,519
polish roots and accept and embrace the

220
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,920
Prussian imperialism so the prussians

221
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,560
got to one conclusion you see the adults

222
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,240
were too proud of of their polish roots

223
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,480
and nothing would Chang their minds they

224
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,920
were simply a lost cause but the

225
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,880
children the children were different you

226
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,760
see the children could be indoctrinated

227
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,120
into a proud Prussian imperialist and

228
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,920
what better way to do that than

229
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,760
brainwash them through their entire

230
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,120
childhood and that is how the Prussian

231
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,800
education system was born and it worked

232
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:28,000
I mean kids would come in as bright

233
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,680
creative enthusiastic children and come

234
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,079
out as Obed iian mindless and not

235
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,640
capable of thinking for themselves and

236
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:36,680
most importantly convinced that the king

237
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,000
is just and his decisions should never

238
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,720
be questioned and these kids well they

239
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,040
made for perfect soldiers and after only

240
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,200
a few short years the masses had no

241
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,600
independent thinking left inside of them

242
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,640
and that was the Prussian model of

243
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,680
obedience and it was the first chapter

244
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,640
of what I like to call the conditioning

245
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,120
Factory and I'll explain in detail what

246
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,640
I mean by that over the next few

247
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,680
chapters because and I know this is hard

248
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,630
to believe

249
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,200
it gets so much

250
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:07,880
[Music]

251
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,600
worse the secret origins of the modern

252
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,079
day education system now there is

253
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,360
something really important for you to

254
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:15,399
understand here virtually all of the big

255
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,600
problems that we face today are a direct

256
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,920
consequence of what I'm about to uncover

257
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,760
right now and this is the reason you

258
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,920
fail to succeed not because you're a

259
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,000
failure but because the system has been

260
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,079
set up for you to fail from the get-go

261
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,720
and the thing you need to understand is

262
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,640
you will keep failing until you

263
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,440
understand the root of the problem and

264
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,120
more importantly address it otherwise

265
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,760
every single thing that you try every

266
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,279
single new job every single new Venture

267
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,560
every single new business every single

268
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:44,920
new side hustle will just be different

269
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,800
paths that lead to the same destination

270
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,560
failure and you might think that if you

271
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,440
are not currently in college or if you

272
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,480
dropped out of school this doesn't

273
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,200
really apply to you and that is another

274
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,800
way that they keep you indoctrinated

275
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,680
because listen you may have skipped a

276
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,120
few steps of their indoctrination plan

277
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,600
but at the end of the day if you follow

278
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,639
the traditional path and end up in some

279
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,320
soulless corporate career then you're

280
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,079
still a part of their system because it

281
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,320
goes Way Beyond the education system

282
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,920
itself and I'm going to show you exactly

283
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,959
how in the next chapters so if you don't

284
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,440
want failure to be the final result of

285
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,399
every single Venture you try in life pay

286
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,200
very close attention because I'm about

287
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:23,120
to show you the root of the problem and

288
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,399
then I'll show you how you can address

289
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,320
it I should reply that the very

290
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,079
recognition of an Reliance upon Free

291
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,320
Will in the pupil is the first mistake

292
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,959
of the old system you have to remember

293
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,360
that the reason the Prussian created its

294
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,839
education system in the first place is

295
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,200
because they belied that individuals who

296
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,800
had Free Will were a threat to their

297
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,760
imperialist regime they imposed risk to

298
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,360
the system the Prussian intellectuals

299
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,519
saw Free Will of their people as the

300
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,000
number one risk to their empire and all

301
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,639
of this hatred towards Free Will derived

302
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,560
from the school of thought of one single

303
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,360
philosopher one philosopher in

304
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,360
particular who was the biggest influence

305
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,720
to the Prussian education system this

306
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,600
guy was responsible for turning their

307
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,160
system into a conditioning Factory that

308
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,920
strips citizens of their Free Will and

309
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,240
turns them into obedient and Mindless

310
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,160
citizens he went by the name of Johan

311
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,320
gotle Fitch and here's what he

312
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,920
envisioned for their education system in

313
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,880
his own words education should aim at

314
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,160
destroying Free Will so that after

315
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,839
pupils are thus schooled they will be

316
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,000
incapable throughout the rest of their

317
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,600
lives of thinking or acting otherwise

318
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,480
than as their school Masters would have

319
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,440
wished when this Tech te has been

320
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,480
perfected every government that has been

321
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,560
in charge of education for more than one

322
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,360
generation will be able to control its

323
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,320
subjects securely without the need of

324
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,680
armies or policemen he has literally

325
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,079
written that down in his books and

326
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,920
notice how from the get-go the system

327
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:49,040
was built with the interest of its

328
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,760
creators in mind rather than the

329
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,880
interest of the students that go through

330
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,639
the systems themselves and you'll soon

331
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,760
see how this is a very common theme that

332
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,639
repeats many times but before that I ask

333
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,040
you the question what are the odds that

334
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,320
some someone going through a system

335
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,279
built on these principles and turning

336
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,920
out to be successful in life becoming a

337
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,720
free independent individual how more

338
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,639
likely are they to turn into a mere

339
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,360
product of the system very likely now

340
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,399
you probably don't even suspect it but

341
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,279
if you're watching this chances are you

342
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,279
went through this system

343
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,839
yourself

344
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,519
1843 that was a very pivotal year that

345
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:26,600
set the foundation for the modern day

346
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:28,880
Education System enter a man that goes

347
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,959
by the name Horus man you see Horus man

348
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,600
was a notorious American Congressman

349
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,480
part of the US House of Representatives

350
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,120
of the American Congress who later will

351
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,279
be known as the father of American

352
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,199
public education just a short 5 years

353
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,320
before he had been nominated the head of

354
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:45,959
the newly created Board of Education of

355
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,040
Massachusetts and he had one mission to

356
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,600
reform the American education system for

357
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,720
years he had been researching different

358
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,839
education models in European countries

359
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,320
to find successful case studies that he

360
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,519
could export back to the USA and finally

361
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,959
he found what he was looking for and yes

362
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,839
of course you guessed it the Prussian

363
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:07,360
education system and he had one goal in

364
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:09,440
mind implementing the same system in the

365
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,120
US I mean after all if that system

366
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,519
managed to remove every ounce of

367
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,639
nationalism from the people of a country

368
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,000
that was brutally invaded I mean what

369
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,880
could it do for the interests back in

370
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,279
America well it was definitely easy to

371
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,279
say that Horus man had big plans for the

372
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,519
newly discovered conditioning Factory I

373
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,519
mean education system and he was so

374
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,199
impressed with the results that the

375
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:30,440
prussians were getting that he decided

376
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:32,680
to Pur personally traveled to Germany

377
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,480
with a board of Educators so that way he

378
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,279
could learn in person the inner workings

379
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,000
of their system and after returning to

380
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:41,639
the US he went on a campaign and lobbied

381
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,199
heavily in Congress for this exact same

382
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,440
system to be adopted in the US and it

383
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:47,639
really didn't take too long for his

384
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,880
efforts to start creating results over

385
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,959
the next three decades multiple American

386
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,839
dignitaries traveled to Germany to get

387
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,600
degrees directly from the Prussian

388
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,600
system they would then come back to the

389
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,040
US and staff the universities and

390
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,880
schools AC across the country and by the

391
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,120
1900s all of the phds in the US were

392
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,759
trained in Prussia in just a few short

393
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,199
years Horus had the system streamlined

394
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:10,800
he had the people in place he had the

395
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,000
funding from the government and the

396
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,959
support from the public who backed his

397
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,199
Noble idea of making education public

398
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:19,720
widely available he had successfully

399
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:21,880
implemented what's described as the

400
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,639
first stage of conditioning in the

401
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,680
conditioning Factory book and now he was

402
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,440
on to the second stage the goal maximize

403
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,319
the reach of the system

404
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,360
and he came up with a very clever way to

405
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:36,240
do that have you ever asked yourself why

406
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,040
is education mandatory well Horus is to

407
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,480
blame for that too his 10th annual

408
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,759
report in 1846 led to the first state

409
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,440
law that made it mandatory for kids to

410
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:46,040
attend school in the state of

411
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,360
Massachusetts so now you have two

412
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,000
options you either give your children to

413
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,000
the government to let them indoctrinate

414
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,319
them with their ideals or the second

415
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
option is you get thrown into jail and

416
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:57,759
it's no wonder that attendance raids

417
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,040
started to Skyrocket and that same year

418
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,519
he supported the government governor of

419
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,800
Massachusetts in adopting the Prussian

420
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:07,839
model of education for the entire

421
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,279
State and how did he do that let's just

422
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,519
say that the governor of the state at

423
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,720
the time was the very first to receive a

424
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,720
PhD from Russia once the system was

425
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,680
completely implemented in Massachusetts

426
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,319
the game was on the system started to

427
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,800
spread itself throughout the US in

428
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:24,279
record time it spread to New York and

429
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,160
then other states soon followed slowly

430
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:28,880
but surely parents children and society

431
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,319
as a whole started to accept C the

432
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,880
Prussian model as the only sensible way

433
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:38,240
of educating children without ever

434
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,199
suspecting the true motives behind it

435
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,440
and by the end of the 1800s the Prussian

436
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,759
system had dominated America to make

437
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,759
sure they'd killed any remaining traces

438
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,680
of other education systems by 1864

439
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,240
Congress made it illegal for Native

440
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,040
American kids to be taught in their

441
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,720
native language instead they'd be sent

442
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,040
away to boarding schools to go through

443
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,120
the same conditioning Factory from then

444
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:03,639
on every single American child grew up

445
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,959
under the Prussian system of obedience

446
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:06,919
now listen if you're not from the US

447
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,439
you're probably thinking right now well

448
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:09,720
I'm not from the US so that doesn't

449
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,280
really affect me what does this have to

450
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,679
do with me well I'm sorry to tell you

451
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,160
but at this point the influence of the

452
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,199
Prussian education system it was already

453
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,720
growing internationally with the help of

454
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:23,439
prussians and Horus man himself you see

455
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,480
soon after the Canadian superintendent

456
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,559
of schools well he came to Horus to

457
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,480
learn more about the system himself and

458
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:31,760
also ended up travel to Prussia to go

459
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,640
through the same process that Horus did

460
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,799
and on the other side of the ocean the

461
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,960
Prussian Empire grew its influence in

462
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:41,280
Europe more and more and with that their

463
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,760
system started to spread accordingly

464
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,799
across the entire continent and it got

465
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,960
even worse after World War II but more

466
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:50,120
on that later for now what you need to

467
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,200
understand is this if you went to school

468
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,120
either in the US Canada South America or

469
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,039
a country from Europe you have been

470
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,240
indoctrinated through the Prussian

471
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,000
system and if that's the the case you

472
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:05,350
need to understand how this system has

473
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,949
impacted you and what it is doing to you

474
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:09,949
[Music]

475
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,840
today let's go back to our favorite

476
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,000
Prussian philosopher Johan gotl fit the

477
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,559
new education must consist essentially

478
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,679
in this that it completely destroys

479
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,960
freedom of will in the soil which it

480
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,880
undertakes to cultivate and produces on

481
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,840
the cont strict necessity in the

482
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,000
decisions of the will the the opposite

483
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,960
being impossible such a will can

484
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,159
henceforth be relied on with confidence

485
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,120
and certainty now how would they achieve

486
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,080
this level of social conditioning for

487
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,080
that they needed an effective method

488
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,520
Well turns out that Johan not only

489
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,640
developed the philosophy behind the

490
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,400
Prussian education system but he also

491
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,559
developed the method through which it

492
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,640
would accomplish his goal of destroying

493
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,280
the Free Will of students and making

494
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,200
them lifelong slaves of their school

495
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,480
Masters combined John Lock's view that

496
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,520
the human mind at Birth Earth is a blank

497
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,640
slate and ru's ideas on how to write on

498
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,120
that blank slate he established a

499
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,200
scientific method on how to indoctrinate

500
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,200
children and strip them of their Free

501
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,760
Will and the method consisted of first

502
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,679
carefully choosing the subjects that

503
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,840
students must learn what they should

504
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,039
think about and for how long instead of

505
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,799
allowing them to discover what they like

506
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:23,240
and are naturally talented at

507
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:25,440
standardized books that would have

508
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,559
students believing the sides of history

509
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,120
and philosophy that was most convenient

510
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:32,679
to the states interests then they would

511
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,480
also standardize testing across all

512
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:36,280
schools and made sure that the right

513
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,280
answers were the answers that they

514
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,559
wanted to hear from the students in case

515
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,400
the students were thinking for

516
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:43,240
themselves instead of thinking how the

517
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,280
system wanted them to think they'd

518
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,559
simply get punished through their grades

519
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,480
and talking about punishing they'd also

520
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:51,360
punished children who misbehave the

521
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,960
entire system was set in a way to

522
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,840
enforce discipline in obedience children

523
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,240
would have to ask for permission to talk

524
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,760
to drink water and to go to the bathroom

525
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,200
to stand up to do anything and I'm not

526
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,960
sure if you've noticed this but they

527
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,880
purposely made the schools look like

528
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,400
prisons that's why they put the children

529
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,000
sitting in rows that's why they had

530
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,720
alarm Bells that's why they had strict

531
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,840
timings for classes and intervals had

532
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,240
children in classes based on age groups

533
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,440
as well as have the children listening

534
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,520
to what a teacher says with little to no

535
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,280
interaction and a very important part of

536
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,559
the method as well was having the

537
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,640
teachers themselves not realizing that

538
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:27,320
what they were doing was indoctrinating

539
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,120
the youth you see from the teachers

540
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,440
perspective they're just doing their job

541
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,559
by educating the youth and most

542
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,400
importantly having a Time intensive

543
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:37,240
curriculum that took the children away

544
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,240
from their families for majority of the

545
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,159
day lowering their family time to a

546
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,919
minimum so that way that the families

547
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:44,559
wouldn't have a chance to teach them

548
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:46,919
their own values and they would learn

549
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,919
their values the way the system wanted

550
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,840
them to instead now let me ask you

551
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:52,600
something how oddly similar is this

552
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,400
system to the one that we have across

553
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,159
the world today how many of those things

554
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,159
have you experienced yourself when you

555
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,760
were in school and this is why I'm

556
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,080
telling you this is not a mere

557
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,080
coincidence and it all comes from the

558
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,840
three secret figures who wrote the book

559
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,960
on how to create a conditioning Factory

560
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:13,440
and turn free individuals into obedient

561
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,679
mindless Factory workers Johan himself

562
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,039
now the big question is why does no one

563
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,400
know about him why do we not learn about

564
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:22,360
the true secret origins of our education

565
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,640
system well maybe that's because the

566
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,799
model was designed with the interests of

567
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,159
the Elites in mind instead of the

568
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,640
interests of the individual and they had

569
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:34,200
to keep that fact hidden so that the

570
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:37,559
masses wouldn't suspect of their most

571
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:40,039
effective tool of mass control oh and

572
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:41,880
maybe it's also because one of the other

573
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:43,559
small details I forgot to mention about

574
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,880
our very forward thinking philosopher

575
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:49,559
Johan you see after Berlin was occupied

576
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,640
by Napoleon in 1807 Johan actually gave

577
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:53,679
a series of very famous addresses to the

578
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,440
German nation and on them he actually

579
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,799
spoke about the superiority of the

580
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,039
German people above all others and he

581
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:02,279
would fervently call for United German

582
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:04,640
nation and preach them as a unique

583
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,679
culture and spiritual entity and the

584
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,200
content of these speeches was a catalyst

585
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:11,440
for the Prussian education system does

586
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,000
that does that ring a bell to you maybe

587
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,720
about I don't know another Infamous

588
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,440
movement that happened in Germany you

589
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,480
know that preached about the superiority

590
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,360
of Germans above all other races and how

591
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,880
they should act as one United Nation

592
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,080
something like that like I feel like

593
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,440
there was a guy who used to talk about

594
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,559
that now if that still doesn't ring a

595
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,000
bell for you let me just go ahead and

596
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,840
make it even easier for you in other

597
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,200
early Works Johan also called Jews a

598
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,440
state within a state that would

599
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,640
undermine the German nation and he

600
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,760
openly expressed a desire to expel Jews

601
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:43,240
from Germany so he basically preached

602
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,640
German superiority he called for United

603
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,039
German nation and he wanted to expel

604
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,880
Jews from

605
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,320
Germany yeah I I feel like I've

606
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,320
definitely seen this before well it

607
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,360
turns out that Yan had a deep influence

608
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,760
on the rise of the Third Reich and his

609
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,240
addresses to the German Nation contained

610
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,440
elements of a cultural and linguistic

611
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,919
nationalism that the Nazis would later

612
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,400
heavily draw upon and most importantly

613
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,640
historians point out that one of the

614
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,000
greatest social factors that allowed

615
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,360
Nazism to achieve Mass adoption in

616
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,120
Germany was because of how German people

617
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,400
were bred from birth to be obedient and

618
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,120
to respect authority without ever

619
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,400
questioning all because of their

620
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,559
indoctrination based education system

621
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,600
that was implemented decades earlier

622
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,559
from the work of Johan still to this day

623
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,760
y is seen as one of the biggest

624
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:35,000
influences of Nazism and neo-nazism

625
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,840
which means that the current day

626
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,360
education system employed all around the

627
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,200
world is based on the System created by

628
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,240
one of the biggest influencers of the

629
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,600
Nazis yeah no wonder they don't want you

630
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,039
to know about the true origins of the

631
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,480
education system and it also begs the

632
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:54,880
question why would the father of modern

633
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,240
education make it a law that every child

634
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,039
spend their youth in a System created by

635
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,760
the father of neo-nazism and how are we

636
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:04,039
setting ourselves up knowing that the

637
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,440
entirety of the population from North

638
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:08,279
America to Europe today were raised in

639
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,720
the same system adopted by pre-nazi

640
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:13,039
Germany I'm going to give you a spoiler

641
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,640
it is directly related to the woke

642
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,640
culture and the war on free speech that

643
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,080
we are experiencing today and I'm going

644
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,840
to cover this in detail in episode two

645
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,640
that goes live on Thursday now are you

646
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,000
convinced yet that the education system

647
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,799
you went through was never actually

648
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,080
created to make you a critical thinker

649
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,559
and a free successful individual but

650
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:34,600
rather turn you into a brainwashed

651
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:36,919
prisoner of the system if not don't

652
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:40,120
worry this is still just the tip of the

653
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:42,919
iceberg it gets so much worse you see

654
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:45,039
this system wasn't complete yet despite

655
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:47,600
the efforts of horse man he never

656
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,960
managed to push America to stage two of

657
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,480
conditioning you see at this point

658
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,720
America and the other countries that had

659
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,600
recently implemented the Prussian model

660
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,799
well they were still in stage one of

661
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,039
conditioning they obeyed and believed

662
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,640
everything that their government would

663
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:02,600
say meaning their Free Will was already

664
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,600
gone which was wonderful for the

665
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,240
government itself but not everyone was

666
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,080
completely happy with it that's because

667
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,200
the recent industrial revolution had

668
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,640
caused a shift in Powers the government

669
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,679
wasn't the biggest man on the Block

670
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,640
anymore America had new kings that

671
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:19,080
quickly ascended to the positions of

672
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,880
power these were the corporate Titans

673
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,000
and one in particular had a big need

674
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,120
that he wanted to fulfill John D

675
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,880
Rockefeller you see at the time his oil

676
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,279
Empire was growing so much that his

677
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,279
biggest bottleneck

678
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:34,279
was one thing and one thing only Factory

679
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:37,080
workers he needed a herd of mindless

680
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:39,799
obedient workers to work in oil rigs

681
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,720
extraction Transportation refineries Etc

682
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:44,279
and he saw in the Prussian education

683
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,760
system the perfect opportunity to create

684
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:49,440
that much-needed herd of mindless

685
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:52,240
obedient Factory workers to slave away

686
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,360
for his Empire he too had read the

687
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,440
conditioning Factory book on how to turn

688
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,000
regular people into products of the

689
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,399
system and he noted that Horus man had

690
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,960
missed a few key steps that if were

691
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:06,320
implemented would create the exact type

692
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,520
of brainwashed workers that he needed

693
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,799
the biggest one was the public education

694
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,880
system that Horus had implemented still

695
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,399
didn't have a standard curriculum to

696
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,440
follow and that was one of the key

697
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:19,039
pillars for the Prussian model and in

698
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,840
rockefeller's mind the deal was simple

699
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,640
the kids weren't learning anything that

700
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:26,399
were of any use in any oil refinery mine

701
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,600
or factory it didn't matter how obedient

702
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:31,360
the masses were if they couldn't work in

703
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,760
his oil Empire to expand his operations

704
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,279
further so Rockefeller also saw the need

705
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,720
of indoctrinating the American

706
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:40,159
population into the narrative that work

707
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,559
would set them free this way they had a

708
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,520
reason something to work for their life

709
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,799
would now have meaning so what did

710
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:50,080
Rockefeller do he came up with a plan to

711
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:52,080
infiltrate and take over control over

712
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,600
the public education system and he

713
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,640
teamed up with one of his closest

714
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,240
advisor Frederick Tates to turn that

715
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,520
plan into reality

716
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,000
and this is how we go back to the

717
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,360
meeting from the beginning of the

718
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,840
episode the plan they had was simple yet

719
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,120
very effective create a board that

720
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,000
sounded like an official government

721
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,799
board for Education get the board

722
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,679
officially approved by the government

723
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,360
and then push the agenda of promoting

724
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:17,919
education without the distinction of

725
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,880
race sex or Creed in order to get the

726
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,320
government funding and approval to

727
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,520
massively scale the school network and

728
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,760
then instill in the masses the idea that

729
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,840
only work could set them free and in

730
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,159
order to get a high-paying job they

731
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,679
needed education and here's the plan in

732
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:35,559
Frederick's own words in our dream we

733
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,640
have Limitless resources and the people

734
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:40,360
yield themselves with perfect docility

735
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,000
to our molding hand we shall not try to

736
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,000
make these people or any of their

737
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,840
children into philosophers or men of

738
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,960
learning or men of science we're not to

739
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,320
raise up among them authors orators

740
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,799
poets or men of letters we shall not

741
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,919
search for embryo great artists painters

742
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,720
musicians nor will cherish even the

743
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:00,760
humbler ambition to raise up from among

744
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,480
them lawyers doctors preacher statement

745
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,159
of whom we now have ample Supply and

746
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,320
that plan is what led to the creation of

747
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,200
the general Board of Education as I

748
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,519
mentioned at the beginning of the video

749
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,120
by 1903 Rockefeller and Gates had

750
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:16,080
successfully secured the government

751
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,480
approval for their board alongside 3.5

752
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,840
billion in funding to build thousands of

753
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,720
schools across the country in a few

754
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,240
short years this absolutely transformed

755
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,480
the amount of schools in the United

756
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,039
States of America and after that every

757
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,720
new generation will go to school ready

758
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,679
to learn and become critical thinkers

759
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,840
only to come out of school as an

760
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,279
obedient factory worker with no big

761
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,880
aspirations workers who are perfectly

762
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:42,840
happy working a factory job with no

763
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,720
Prospect of ever being truly free in

764
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,360
their life I mean after all they believe

765
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,279
that only work could set them free and

766
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,039
that's what they were doing turning you

767
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:55,840
into a product of the system someone who

768
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,000
gets treated like a product that at the

769
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,399
end of the day can be easily replaced

770
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,320
they will never do more than what it was

771
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,120
manufactured to do and that it has an

772
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,360
expiry date and with that Rockefeller

773
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,480
successfully turned America into stage

774
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,720
two conditioning by simply following the

775
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,679
steps that was laid down decades earlier

776
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,799
by the Great Prussian philosopher and

777
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,799
secret figure Johan Gauntlet fit that's

778
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,640
exactly what Rockefeller had just

779
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,320
accomplished and that's how John D

780
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,799
Rockefeller himself also wrote his name

781
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,200
as co-author of the conditioning Factory

782
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:30,039
book and became the Third secret figure

783
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,840
that created the modern day education

784
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:35,399
system or conditioning Factory should I

785
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,559
say soon enough other industry tycoons

786
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:39,240
were jumping into the education ship

787
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:41,399
Andrew Carnegie started to sponsor

788
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,720
public education I mean he too needed

789
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:46,559
more machine workers Engineers mine

790
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,600
operators railroad workers repairmen the

791
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,840
list goes on you know who else jumped on

792
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,600
this bandwagon Ford himself in just a

793
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,679
few years they had the entire system

794
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,840
streamlined from state sponsored

795
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,760
textbooks and standardized tests to

796
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,039
indoctrinating teachers under this new

797
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,200
Prussian Rockefeller model of Education

798
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,000
rockefeller's plan had worked and in his

799
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,600
own words I don't want a nation of

800
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,880
thinkers I want a nation of workers can

801
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,360
you now see why you haven't succeeded

802
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,480
even though you've put in a lot of

803
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,519
effort into everything you've been told

804
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,120
that would make you successful going to

805
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,960
school getting good grades getting a

806
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:27,000
good degree working a safe job it was

807
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,840
all a setup from the GetGo it was never

808
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,279
me for you to succeed in the way you

809
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:34,679
want to but rather for you to experience

810
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,720
success in their terms it was only meant

811
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:39,720
for you to become a product of the

812
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,200
system but that wasn't enough

813
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,360
Rockefeller was an extremely ambitious

814
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:48,559
man and he wanted to take things a step

815
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,320
further so here's what he did instead of

816
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:54,039
only focusing on high schools he started

817
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:56,159
investing heavily in universities this

818
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:58,240
way instead of indoctrinating people

819
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,000
only until their teenager years he could

820
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,600
keep indoctrinating them throughout

821
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,360
their adulthood turning them into even

822
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,440
better brainwashed mindless Factory

823
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,960
workers selling the idea of college to

824
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,600
the masses was pretty easy I mean they

825
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,440
had already believed the narrative that

826
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,480
work would set them free and that the

827
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,039
only way to get good work is by being

828
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,480
educated so now what did he do he

829
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,320
conditioned them into thinking that

830
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,440
education equals College something that

831
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:28,000
the majority of people around the world

832
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,000
still believe to be true to this very

833
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,639
day and that is the power of a narrative

834
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,639
and I personally think that Rockefeller

835
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:37,679
himself didn't even realize what he had

836
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:39,960
just created as a byproduct of that he

837
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,399
had just set up the foundations for one

838
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,320
of the biggest Mass control tools that

839
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,799
is still used by governments and

840
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,200
universities to this day and this was

841
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:53,720
the start of our modern-day abusive love

842
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,720
relationship with college

843
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,029
degrees

844
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,029
[Music]

845
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:11,519
1957 one of the most iconic moments of

846
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,159
the Cold War had just unraveled you see

847
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,080
Russia launched the first man-made

848
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:18,200
satellite to the orbit of the Earth with

849
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:20,960
Sputnik one and this had very big

850
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,679
consequences to the Americans why

851
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,559
because it meant that using the same

852
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:26,799
technology Russia could potentially

853
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,639
launch nuclear Rockets into American

854
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,200
Terr

855
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:31,240
so American politicians came to one

856
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,320
conclusion if America wanted to win the

857
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,320
war then they needed more College grads

858
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,039
to build such Technologies and Factory

859
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,760
workers weren't enough now they needed

860
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:42,120
highly specialized Engineers but the

861
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,320
problem was even though tuition was way

862
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:46,639
cheaper than it is today it was still

863
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,360
expensive to the standards of the time

864
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:50,320
and that's when Dwight Eisenhower

865
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,639
president at the time decided to take a

866
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,320
page out of rockefeller's book and make

867
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:58,519
higher education widely available to the

868
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:00,799
population how through widely available

869
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:02,480
student loans now after getting the idea

870
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,519
approved on Congress he signed a

871
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,039
National Defense Education Act and that

872
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:09,200
created the National Defense Student

873
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:11,600
Loan program I mean after all who could

874
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,200
go against a National Defense Initiative

875
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,360
especially in the height of the Cold War

876
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:19,360
and that was the beginning of something

877
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,120
huge why because all universities

878
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,919
realized something with the right

879
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,480
approach to this they would never have

880
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:27,440
to worry about money ever again because

881
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,159
the government was willing to spend an

882
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:33,080
unlimited amount of money on them and

883
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,399
here's where things take a turn you see

884
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,919
after a few years the government had

885
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,399
broken through a100 billion in student

886
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:41,880
loans which would be equivalent to $1

887
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:43,240
trillion today and that presented the

888
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,440
government with a little bit of a

889
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,279
problem they started to question for how

890
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,880
long would this be sustainable knowing

891
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,799
that students would only be paying this

892
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,039
back 4 years later and in small portions

893
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:55,919
over multiple years so they decided to

894
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:58,200
do something they asked the bankers for

895
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,760
help and that was the nail in the coffin

896
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,480
because they had just pushed America

897
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,880
into stage three conditioning how

898
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,399
through the modern student loan system

899
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,240
in 1965 Congress passed something called

900
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,800
The Higher Education Act and it

901
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,359
basically got almost every single

902
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,839
student a guaranteed loan and how did

903
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:19,079
they do that through Federal guaranteed

904
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:21,119
loans the government set up guarantee

905
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:23,720
agencies that would guarantee the loans

906
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,240
made by Banks were always paid back and

907
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,159
what you really need to understand is

908
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,159
how they made that happen the Banks

909
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:32,280
would give out the student loans just as

910
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,760
normal but here's where the twist is for

911
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,320
every single student loan that the bank

912
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,359
gave out the government would give

913
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,280
around 80% of the total value of the

914
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,240
loan to guarantee agency then if a

915
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,159
student didn't pay back their loan the

916
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,320
government agency would buy the loan

917
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,200
from the bank and attempt to collect on

918
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,679
it so this really shifted the risk of

919
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,720
the default from the banks to the

920
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,359
guarantee agencies but the weird thing

921
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:56,040
is that the guarantee agencies were also

922
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,400
guaranteed and that's because the

923
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,079
federal government

924
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,960
agreed to reimburse the guarantee

925
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:03,400
agencies for 90% or more of the loans

926
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,119
that they couldn't collect now this

927
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,160
created a very interesting situation

928
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,920
because kids had access to money that

929
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,000
wasn't theirs so they were willing to

930
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,440
spend it no matter what the price was

931
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,599
and if the kid drops out the government

932
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:17,000
is still going to pay the bill meaning

933
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:18,760
that there was no risk for universities

934
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,800
and they knew that which also meant that

935
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,119
no matter how much they raised tuition

936
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,480
the government would still pay it off

937
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:25,960
because they had the goal of making

938
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,960
America the most educated country in the

939
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,560
world and the money was also not coming

940
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,839
from the government's pocket so they

941
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,760
didn't really care how much was being

942
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:34,880
spent and that created a situation where

943
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,680
the colleges were incentivized to rack

944
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,640
up their prices so what did colleges do

945
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,320
they started to Rack it up in the' 60s

946
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,320
alone they increased tuition 30% above

947
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,760
inflation and this led to a Snowball

948
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,560
Effect colleges started expanding to be

949
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,079
able to accommodate more and more

950
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,000
students which really created a

951
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,720
self-fulfilling cycle more students

952
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,319
would apply to college so the colleges

953
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,640
raised their tuition and with higher

954
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:59,319
tuition more students needed loans now

955
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,240
the more loans they gave out the more

956
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:02,640
money the lenders make off of you and

957
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,960
that turned the entire conditioning

958
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,480
system to a whole new level now they

959
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,760
were able to indoctrinate you through

960
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,480
your entire childhood create a herd of

961
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,160
mindless obedient Factory workers

962
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,119
through college and also make hundreds

963
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,000
of thousands of dollars off of every

964
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,319
single student throughout the entire

965
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,280
indoctrination process they had finally

966
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:23,480
managed to implement something that not

967
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,839
even the prussians managed to do stage

968
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,079
three conditioning they brainwash you

969
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,359
then they make you a product of the

970
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:32,839
system and to top it all off they make

971
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:34,319
you pay cop amounts of money to do so I

972
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:36,119
mean listen if you think about it that's

973
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:37,920
even better than slavery because at the

974
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:39,839
end of the day slaves don't pay you

975
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,599
students on the other hand they pay you

976
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,640
for that privilege and here's the most

977
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,960
interesting part about the entire loan

978
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,800
system the loans themselves became the

979
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,000
reason as to why people needed loans in

980
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:53,440
the first place because the loans are

981
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,240
why colleges are so expensive so now you

982
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,280
needed a loan to go to college but

983
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,040
without the loan tuition would have just

984
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,040
stayed the same I mean you can clearly

985
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,280
see it by first looking at how steady

986
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,520
tuition used to be before student loans

987
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,200
were widely available now look at the

988
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,359
increased intuition rates after they

989
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,359
became widely available and now compare

990
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,680
them to how much the inflation rate and

991
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,040
income increased during that same period

992
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,359
and you can see how this created a

993
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,200
vicious cycle of the average citizen not

994
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,920
being able to afford tuition to send

995
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,760
their kids to college because tuitions

996
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:26,359
have grown 1200% while their salaries

997
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,640
only grew a fraction of that then that

998
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:30,680
CA es the need for student loans which

999
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,760
in turn makes colleges even more

1000
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:36,040
expensive it is a NeverEnding cycle to

1001
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,040
make even more money off of your back

1002
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:40,119
colleges have turned into a money-making

1003
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,079
machine for the administrators the

1004
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:43,560
debtors the bankers and the board

1005
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,040
members some people even call it

1006
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,079
history's biggest scam and just so you

1007
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,440
really understand I want to put it into

1008
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,359
perspective just how much money colleges

1009
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,160
truly have here's how much money some of

1010
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:56,160
the biggest companies in the world have

1011
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,040
in their cash and short-term investment

1012
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:02,680
balance McDonald's $1.6 billion

1013
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:07,160
Starbucks $3.2 billion Disney $1.5

1014
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:10,240
billion Coca-Cola $15.7 billion meta $

1015
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:12,680
53.4 billion now let's take a look at

1016
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,000
how much the top 10 private universities

1017
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,359
just in the us alone have in their

1018
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,599
endowments Washington University $12

1019
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:21,960
billion the bottom of our list here

1020
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:23,920
already has 10 times more than

1021
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,119
McDonald's and three times more than

1022
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,040
Starbucks Columbia university1 13

1023
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:28,800
billion

1024
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,200
more than Disney by the way Northwestern

1025
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,800
University $14 billion University of

1026
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,960
Notre Dam $16 billion which by the way

1027
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:40,400
is the same as Coca-Cola University of

1028
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:43,400
Pennsylvania $20 billion MIT $24 billion

1029
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,359
Princeton University $35 billion

1030
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:49,079
Stanford University $36 billion Yale

1031
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:52,720
University $41 billion Harvard

1032
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:55,319
University $49 billion Harvard has more

1033
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,880
cash than most Fortune 500 companies and

1034
00:38:55,319 --> 00:38:59,920
just in the us alone there's over 130

1035
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,200
universities with more than $1 billion

1036
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,520
in their endowments and coincidence or

1037
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:07,319
not the one with the highest amount per

1038
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:11,040
student you guessed it the Rockefeller

1039
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:13,079
University who has over $35 million in

1040
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,800
their reserves for every single student

1041
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:16,079
in their University I mean what else

1042
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,680
could you expect from the family of the

1043
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,480
man that quite literally created this

1044
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,920
entire system right now how do these

1045
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,359
universities make that much money you

1046
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,000
may ask is it all from tuitions and

1047
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,319
here's where things get a little fishy

1048
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,359
you see if you check their financial

1049
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:31,280
reports tuition only amounts to around

1050
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:33,400
20% of their yearly revenue and that

1051
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,880
seems quite odd doesn't it I mean how

1052
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,160
else would a university make that much

1053
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,560
money well they have another 10% that

1054
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,480
they make from federal sponsored

1055
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,640
researches meaning by the way that if

1056
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,440
you're a taxpayer you are paying them

1057
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,240
directly out of your pocket but that's

1058
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,599
not the interesting part the interesting

1059
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,599
part is that if you were to look at

1060
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,319
Harvard's financials from 2022 you would

1061
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:55,400
see that the biggest chunk of their

1062
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:57,280
revenue comes from philanthropy 45% to

1063
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,119
be exact but if you dig a little bit

1064
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,160
deeper you're going to see that almost

1065
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,440
all of the money under philanthropy that

1066
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,480
comes from something called the net

1067
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,040
endowment distribution now you probably

1068
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,760
know this but universities don't pay any

1069
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,920
taxes I mean after all they're not a

1070
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,040
for-profit organization right all they

1071
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,440
do is create critical thinking citizens

1072
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,160
and improve the quality of the

1073
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,000
population yeah we both know that those

1074
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,240
two could be further from the truth

1075
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,280
here's the thing once universities start

1076
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,960
to really rack up student loans they

1077
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,839
start to just have a lot of cash laying

1078
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,640
around and I mean a lot so what happened

1079
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,560
was Hedge funds started approaching them

1080
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,839
and saying hey instead of keeping all of

1081
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,480
these billions of dollars in your

1082
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:34,400
checking accounts why not just create

1083
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,520
your own hedge fund and multiply this

1084
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,200
money through Investments well there was

1085
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,599
just one problem they couldn't have

1086
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,520
their own hedge funds because they're

1087
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,920
not a for-profit company right so their

1088
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,359
genius solution let's just call it an

1089
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,400
endowment instead then we let a hedge

1090
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:50,160
fund manager manage this money exactly

1091
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,480
as they do in their hedge funds but

1092
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,560
instead it's tax-free now you might

1093
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,599
wonder why this falls under the category

1094
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,079
of philanthropy in their financials well

1095
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:59,920
you've probably seen those multi-million

1096
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,839
dollar donations from Rich individuals

1097
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,599
going to Harvard Yale and other

1098
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:06,520
universities like that one hedge fund

1099
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,560
manager who donated $150 million of his

1100
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,040
own personal money to Harvard well where

1101
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,839
do you think all that money goes do you

1102
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:14,680
think it goes to infrastructure or to

1103
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,480
cover student loans or to their staff no

1104
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,400
no no no that money goes directly to

1105
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,040
their endowment but here's the real

1106
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,079
kicker that money is managed by an

1107
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,880
endowment manager who invest the same

1108
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,640
money in hedge funds and other

1109
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,200
investment products which in turn have

1110
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,000
their own managers who make money

1111
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,520
through management fees meaning at the

1112
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,240
end of the day that donation may or may

1113
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,160
not go back to the original donor

1114
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,400
through management fees of a string of

1115
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,319
financial instruments but with a little

1116
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,119
added bonus the money invested is

1117
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:44,119
taxfree because the universities don't

1118
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,960
pay taxes I mean how genius is that and

1119
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:47,640
this could be a 1hour long video on its

1120
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,440
own but what's important for you to

1121
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,359
understand here is this they use

1122
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,359
universities to further indoctrinate you

1123
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,000
into a product of the system and while

1124
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,400
they do that they also turn you into a

1125
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,200
debt slave to make money off of you

1126
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,640
risk-free and tax-free and most

1127
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,920
importantly this system is not

1128
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,160
sustainable eventually there will be no

1129
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,599
money left to lend and bankroll the

1130
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,560
system and what do you think happens

1131
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:13,170
when the system runs out of money well

1132
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:17,739
that's what you're going to find out

1133
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:17,739
[Music]

1134
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,640
next

1135
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,960
2023 and finally we get to what's

1136
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,400
happening today today for every dollar

1137
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,440
the government loan through student

1138
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,400
loans to tuition goes up by 60 on the

1139
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,319
other hand Harvard has enough money to

1140
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,040
pay the tuition of every single one of

1141
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:38,000
their students for the next 20 years in

1142
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,040
a row so that begs the question why do

1143
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,920
they still make their students get into

1144
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:45,200
hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt

1145
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,599
to get a college degree and it's also a

1146
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,559
very well-known fact that 60% of

1147
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,920
graduates today won't be able to pay

1148
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:54,160
back their student loans if that is the

1149
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,880
case why are the government and Banks

1150
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,760
still lending this money and most

1151
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,760
important importantly what happens when

1152
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,839
the majority of the students don't pay

1153
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,640
back their loans looking at the price

1154
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,960
increase in tuition over the last few

1155
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:08,760
decades and comparing to how quickly it

1156
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,000
grows compared to inflation income and

1157
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,599
all other metrics I can only come to one

1158
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,280
conclusion this is unsustainable and

1159
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,599
eventually this system will collapse

1160
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,920
which means that there's a bubble now

1161
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,680
it's not the regular type of financial

1162
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,480
bubble that we're used to seeing I see

1163
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,520
it more of a personal bubble and here's

1164
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,160
why the job market has changed it's not

1165
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,680
dominated by a few tight end companies

1166
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,000
anymore the internet has really

1167
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,240
democratized the game to a certain

1168
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,520
extent and majority of those companies

1169
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,240
need employees who are critical thinkers

1170
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,920
and they value the skill of solving

1171
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,880
problems over the skill of following

1172
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,000
orders but right now we're still pumping

1173
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,280
mindless obedient workers who don't know

1174
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,040
how to solve any real world problems and

1175
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,880
demand for such people is shrinking

1176
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,520
rapidly so it begs the question is

1177
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,040
getting a degree actually worth the

1178
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,200
investment today and you can probably

1179
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,119
imagine my answer by now now and to be

1180
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,760
honest this is where I'm going to catch

1181
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:02,079
you off guard slightly because my answer

1182
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,200
is yes getting a degree is still worth

1183
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,559
the investment but there's a catch

1184
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,400
there's still a lot of big corporations

1185
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:10,160
that pay six figures to developers

1186
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,880
Engineers data analysts even lawyers and

1187
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,520
doctors usually positions that are stem

1188
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,720
or lawyer slm medicine related so if you

1189
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,200
want to follow one of those careers it

1190
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,200
still makes sense for a certain period

1191
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,800
of time but here's where things take a

1192
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,200
different turn because there's also

1193
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,680
another big caveat here there's one big

1194
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,119
question that I'm sure sure we've all

1195
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,880
asked ourselves before is Success based

1196
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,480
on Merit well if you go into the formal

1197
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,200
job market the truth is it's probably

1198
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,280
not for majority of these big

1199
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,280
high-paying companies they don't hire

1200
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,359
based on merits they don't hire the

1201
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,839
better and most qualified candidates

1202
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:45,720
they hire the ones who graduated from

1203
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:47,000
the best universities and it doesn't

1204
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,720
really matter how good or bad you are

1205
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,640
skill set wise the only thing that

1206
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,240
matters is the University name stamped

1207
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,400
on your diploma so listen if you're not

1208
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,200
going to one of those ivy league

1209
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,200
universities you don't even have a

1210
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,400
chance against your your competition in

1211
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,359
fact it is a very common practice for

1212
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,760
big tech companies to hire all of the

1213
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,480
talent available from such universities

1214
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,760
even if they don't need them and that's

1215
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,359
just to keep the pool of talent empty so

1216
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,160
that way that they competitors they

1217
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,280
don't have anyone to hire and this is

1218
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,520
why I don't know if you've seen it

1219
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,640
before there's thousands and thousands

1220
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:18,240
of these Tik toks and YouTube shorts and

1221
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,599
all this stuff you know all these like

1222
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,960
day in the Liv of a Google software

1223
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,880
engineer and all they do the entire day

1224
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,960
is eat exercise and just wander

1225
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,160
mindlessly around the HQ apparently

1226
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,800
without ever actually doing any work and

1227
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,880
it's because they actually are not doing

1228
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,599
any work now if you're not a graduate

1229
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,160
from one of those universities you're

1230
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,880
just kind of left out of the party no

1231
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,599
matter how good you are because as I

1232
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,559
said in that World the game is not based

1233
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:42,440
on Merit which then brings us back to

1234
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:44,040
the point of the personal bubble because

1235
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,880
here's the thing if these big

1236
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,720
corporations are only hiring based on

1237
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,440
your diploma a majority of those

1238
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,440
employees don't necessarily bring any

1239
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,880
value to the company how sustainable is

1240
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,880
that and the answer is very obvious it's

1241
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,480
not sustainable at all and that's why

1242
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,079
over the last 12 months we've seen Mass

1243
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:02,800
layoffs from Big corporations like

1244
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:05,240
Google meta Uber Etc the bubble is not

1245
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,640
about to burst it already started

1246
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:09,880
bursting so now the obvious question is

1247
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:11,559
how does this affect you and what should

1248
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,920
you be doing well the way that I look at

1249
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:15,119
this is that we're in a very similar

1250
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,720
situation to what happened back in 2008

1251
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,960
during the housing bubble if you don't

1252
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,359
remember let me jog your memory what

1253
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,559
happened back then was this everyone and

1254
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,440
their mom was getting loans to invest in

1255
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:26,760
real estate even though it was obvious

1256
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,280
the ma majority of people getting the

1257
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,440
loans had no way of ever paying back

1258
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,400
such loans I mean you had waiters and

1259
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,559
maids and bus drivers with two mortgages

1260
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,440
on houses but all the lenders they

1261
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:40,079
thought it was fine why because real

1262
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,160
estate was considered the safest

1263
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:45,079
investment in existence I mean no one

1264
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,119
would ever dare bet against Real Estate

1265
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:49,920
and because it was the safest investment

1266
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:52,640
everyone knew it until it wasn't anymore

1267
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,559
and now I see us in a very similar

1268
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,520
situation everyone and their daughter

1269
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:58,480
got approved to student loans that they

1270
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,319
simply cannot pay back but that's not

1271
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,599
even the worst part in my opinion the

1272
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:05,440
worst part is that 99% of the population

1273
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:07,800
today is betting their entire careers on

1274
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,079
what everyone sees as the safest bet go

1275
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,160
to school get a degree work a safe job

1276
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,319
in my opinion today this is one of the

1277
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,640
riskiest paths you could take exactly

1278
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,880
because how the system is set up I have

1279
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,040
just showed you the system is not built

1280
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,559
for you to succeed the system is built

1281
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,000
to strip you out of your critical

1282
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:29,119
thinking and turn you into a brainwashed

1283
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,839
thoughtless obedient modern-day worker a

1284
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,960
product of the system so what used to be

1285
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:36,160
considered the safest route has now

1286
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:39,240
turned into one of the riskiest because

1287
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,599
at any moment this won't be sustainable

1288
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,400
anymore and when that happens everyone

1289
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:46,160
who's a part of the system will have

1290
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:49,040
nowhere to run so what's the solution

1291
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:51,319
well you have two the first one is to

1292
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,839
succeed within the system and as I said

1293
00:47:51,319 --> 00:47:55,440
this is actually still a viable solution

1294
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:57,160
as long as you carefully pick the right

1295
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,000
career and make your way through one of

1296
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:02,440
the top 1% universities today this is

1297
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,280
the only safe way I see of succeeding in

1298
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:07,920
the system the other option is to

1299
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,119
succeed outside of the system and how do

1300
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,960
you do that the first step is to remove

1301
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:13,520
and unwire all of the conditioning you

1302
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,200
have been fed ever since you were 4

1303
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,880
years of age because listen at the end

1304
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,599
of the day if you're watching this you

1305
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,720
most likely live in a country at stage

1306
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:23,240
three conditioning and this is such an

1307
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,640
insane level of conditioning for failure

1308
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,040
that you have been fed throughout your

1309
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,200
entire life that there is no way you

1310
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,800
could ever succeed without first

1311
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,640
addressing the thing that's stopping you

1312
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,200
from succeeding listen if you feel like

1313
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,280
you have put a lot of effort into your

1314
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,760
work and your studies and you have done

1315
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,720
everything that you were told would lead

1316
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,119
you to a successful life but you still

1317
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,520
haven't achieved success yourself that's

1318
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:46,480
why the system was set up for you to

1319
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,960
fail from the GetGo and all of the

1320
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,359
condition you have been fed growing up

1321
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,920
is like a 100t wall in your way to

1322
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:53,680
success and if you don't remove this

1323
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,799
wall from your way you're going to keep

1324
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,079
bumping your head on it mindlessly for

1325
00:48:55,799 --> 00:49:00,319
as long as the wall is still there it is

1326
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,720
only once you remove this that you can

1327
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:04,680
truly experience success in life the

1328
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,000
people who can unwire all of the social

1329
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,160
conditioning that they have been fed

1330
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,359
from the conditioning Factory and manage

1331
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:14,319
to succeed outside of the system is

1332
00:49:10,359 --> 00:49:16,240
someone who I call an outsider now if

1333
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:18,520
succeeding in life and truly becoming

1334
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,760
free as an individual is something that

1335
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,599
you Aspire for in your life then the

1336
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,559
question you should be asking is how do

1337
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:25,839
I become an outsider myself and the

1338
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,119
answer is actually quite simp simple

1339
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:30,799
because the path to becoming an outsider

1340
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:33,200
has already been written tested and

1341
00:49:30,799 --> 00:49:35,240
proven a long time ago long before the

1342
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,799
Prussian education system became a thing

1343
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:39,160
you see the Prussian education system

1344
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:41,040
dates back to the late 1700s and humans

1345
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,839
were around long before that thousands

1346
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,799
of years before that and so was

1347
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:48,040
education I mean education didn't start

1348
00:49:44,799 --> 00:49:50,040
in the late 1700s it started centuries

1349
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:52,079
before that and here's the thing the

1350
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:54,119
ideals and principles that education was

1351
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:57,119
originally built upon were the ideals

1352
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:59,119
that make a successful critical thinking

1353
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,760
free individual they were the ideals

1354
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,880
that created some of the most brilliant

1355
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,319
individuals and brightest minds of the

1356
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,359
world has ever seen we're talking Plato

1357
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:09,440
Aristotle Alexander the Great Leonardo

1358
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:13,000
da Vinci Shakespeare Marcus aelius

1359
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:15,839
Socrates they all learned and followed

1360
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,839
these principles and ideals principles

1361
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:20,599
that can still be applied to this day

1362
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:22,640
and they all became Outsiders in their

1363
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:24,119
own fields of work and what I found out

1364
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,559
is that there are five specific

1365
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:27,000
principles all of these great

1366
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:29,280
individuals followed to become some of

1367
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,599
the most successful individuals to ever

1368
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,920
step foot on this Earth and those five

1369
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,799
lost principles are documented and have

1370
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,119
been lost in ancient writings that date

1371
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:40,680
back to 700 BC which the conditioning

1372
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:43,599
Factory has purposely tried to suppress

1373
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:45,960
and hide from you why because just like

1374
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:48,359
there is a step-by-step book that the

1375
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:50,520
elites followed to indoctrinate you turn

1376
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:53,200
you into mindless factory worker and

1377
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:55,599
keep you a product of the system there's

1378
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,839
also a step by step that teach teaches

1379
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,960
you how to become a truly free

1380
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:02,040
successful individual the content in

1381
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,960
these ancient writings hold the secret

1382
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,760
to Breaking Free of Decades of

1383
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,839
indoctrination that the system has

1384
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,680
injected into your brain the same

1385
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:11,880
secrets that the brightest Minds in the

1386
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,720
world used throughout history to make

1387
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,359
breakthrough scientific discoveries that

1388
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:18,119
changed the world created the biggest

1389
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:20,079
Empires the human race has ever seen and

1390
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:22,079
most importantly become critical

1391
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:24,280
thinkers that achieved success and

1392
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,480
freedom in their own ways and what you

1393
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,559
need to do if you want to succeed today

1394
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,839
is rescue those principles that are

1395
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:33,400
described in detail in these ancient

1396
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:35,559
writings and this is why this event is

1397
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,760
called the rescue my mission here is to

1398
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:39,720
help rescue these five long lost

1399
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,040
principles that were the foundations to

1400
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:45,440
the greatest breakthroughs Humanity has

1401
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:48,480
ever experienced so with all of that

1402
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,839
being said the question now is do you

1403
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,119
want to know what are the five lost

1404
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:54,920
principles in these ancient writings you

1405
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:56,920
will but not today you're not ready for

1406
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,720
it yet you see in order for you to be

1407
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,079
ready you have to complete a mission

1408
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,319
that's because these principles will

1409
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:05,280
only make sense if you apply what you

1410
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:07,119
have learned today so here's what I need

1411
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,760
you to do I know that when I tell people

1412
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,680
about the indoctrination Factory and

1413
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,319
explain that they've conditioned them to

1414
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,440
think in a certain way well a lot of

1415
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:15,760
people are very skeptical about that so

1416
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:18,240
I don't want you to take my word for

1417
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,000
this I want you to ask yourself a few

1418
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,040
questions and then based on the answers

1419
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,720
of those questions you choose what you

1420
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,960
want to believe in do this right now if

1421
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,839
you are the person who is serious about

1422
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,359
success

1423
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:29,200
or you just want to prove me wrong grab

1424
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:31,480
a pen and paper and let's go through

1425
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,520
these questions the first question are

1426
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,559
you afraid of renouncing on the formal

1427
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,720
path whether that be dropping out of

1428
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:39,200
college or quitting your current job

1429
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,079
even if you know that deep down in your

1430
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:44,160
heart that's what you want really think

1431
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:45,640
about this now if you're afraid of it

1432
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,839
where do you think that this fear comes

1433
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:49,839
from I mean after all you have seen

1434
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:52,760
people succeeding outside of the formal

1435
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:55,040
path time and time again yet you're

1436
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,799
still afraid to take the leap so why is

1437
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,400
that now my next question is do you

1438
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:00,880
subconsciously think that following the

1439
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,280
formal path is your only choice you know

1440
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,200
your only chance and not ending up

1441
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,400
homeless on the streets and my follow-up

1442
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,319
question is that if that fear is that

1443
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,599
intense where do you think that comes

1444
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:11,240
from do you think it's something

1445
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,280
rational or a disbelief that has been

1446
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,839
seeded into your brain by the people

1447
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,680
around you maybe your parents maybe your

1448
00:53:14,839 --> 00:53:17,880
teachers maybe your peers now I have a

1449
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,680
few more questions for you to think

1450
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,680
about but you can find them inside of

1451
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,119
the WhatsApp group for the rescue the

1452
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,319
link for it is in the description of

1453
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,000
this video now inside the file you're

1454
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:28,839
also going to find Space to answer those

1455
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,760
questions because I want you to actually

1456
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:32,839
write down your answers because this is

1457
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:35,440
the only way that you'll truly think

1458
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:37,880
about your answers and then on Thursday

00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,559
