2
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,319
you know I just remember day after day

3
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,140
coming downstairs and just seeing my mom

4
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,420
and clipped those [ __ ] coupons and I

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,099
just remember thinking like no like this

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,540
is not this is not going to be my life

7
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,540
this is not going to be our life

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,660
you know if I don't take care of my

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,920
family you know he's not just me and my

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,920
mom no one is

11
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,019
so

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,800
we'll get through it how does this

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,780
moment feel

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,760
this moment feels Bittersweet it feels

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,540
like I guess a sense of accomplishment

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,540
but also

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,680
a nostalgic in a bad way because I don't

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,280
necessarily have the best memories in

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,280
and around here

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:00,000
so guys I don't usually do this thing

21
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,699
where I Vlog and I share my day and life

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,680
and whatnot but this is a video that

23
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,360
means a lot to me so I'd appreciate it

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,659
if you stuck around for the entirety of

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,340
it but um I'm moving out of this house

26
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,619
tomorrow morning

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,840
I've been here for 14 years

28
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:20,050
um it's kind of all I know

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:24,060
but all will be explained in this video

30
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:26,040
[Music]

31
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,040
after a couple years of dating my

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,960
stepdad my mom moved to London and we

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,240
ended up living on the street in his

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,979
house and some back then 20 years ago of

35
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,740
course it was nice living in London

36
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,799
living in an expensive area but my house

37
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,439
was not a home my house wasn't on a

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,560
place that was particularly happy at so

39
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,659
I grew up in a house like this

40
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,780
it's crazy

41
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,280
with no warm water with no heating when

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,100
my stepdad found out I was starting a

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,520
business he cut off the Wi-Fi the walls

44
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,740
were caving in in my room there was mold

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,740
it was a [ __ ] show and to make things

46
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,799
worse my stepdad put cameras not on the

47
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,300
outside on the inside of the house so I

48
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,280
grew up as like a [ __ ] prisoner in my

49
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,280
own house like I was I had someone

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,780
watching me 24 7 and yeah when I say

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,459
this is bittersweet

52
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,160
this is

53
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:22,260
The Last Place on Earth I would want to

54
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,440
buy my mama house The Last Place on

55
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,440
Earth

56
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,920
family office manages the wealth of

57
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,260
families except my family is just

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,459
basically me and my mom so today I'm

59
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,459
just making a very big purchase

60
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:50,580
look Central London residential real

61
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,860
estate is probably the one of the safest

62
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,180
asset classes in the world this is why

63
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,800
the whole world goes everyone buys

64
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,319
property there the Indians the Arabs the

65
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,700
Russians the Chinese

66
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:04,019
crazy 15 buses yeah [ __ ] hell

67
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,000
so after everything's all said and done

68
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:08,220
it'll probably be closer to what four

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,300
million dollars yeah for the purchase so

70
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,420
once I got to a certain age you

71
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,760
basically my stepdad divorced my mom and

72
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,340
my mom got a letter through the mail

73
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,379
from his lawyers that basically said you

74
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,040
have seven days to leave the house she

75
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:24,720
lost her home so at that point obviously

76
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,659
I didn't know how long it would take but

77
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,819
I promised her that I'd buy her the

78
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:37,200
house and I didn't think I could do it

79
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:40,799
soon but yeah I guess I made it happen

80
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,019
today I just haven't been you know as

81
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,659
happy or as engaged as I normally am

82
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,000
sometimes you just get so caught up in

83
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:50,519
the bigger picture you get caught up in

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,440
this person who's doing this more than

85
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,080
you you lose touch of how far you're

86
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,700
going and your own track and at the end

87
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,440
of the day that's the only thing that

88
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,659
matters I'm the type of person who goes

89
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,480
too hard on himself

90
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:05,580
I

91
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,400
you know I I sort of discredit what I've

92
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,700
achieved so far which in the scope of

93
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,280
things to me isn't that much considering

94
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,360
the vision I have and what I want to do

95
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,220
but it's still something to be proud of

96
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,680
and that's something I need to remember

97
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,979
for myself so if you're in the same

98
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,600
position be proud of where you are and

99
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,100
keep moving forward but don't forget

100
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,080
what you've already accomplished and

101
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,120
achieved

102
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,120
[Music]

103
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,419
um

104
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,340
everybody

105
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,660
all right 11 30. okay

106
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:21,780
so I had to sacrifice my queen

107
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,060
in order to keep the king alive so I

108
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,460
told her listen like you're basically

109
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,860
the first person offered this watch

110
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,960
I went to Geneva this weekend with Patek

111
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,080
you know they arranged it

112
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,300
Patek has been very kind to our family

113
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,520
don't screw this up yeah no it should

114
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,080
definitely come for that no but bro my

115
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,000
mom's so funny she's like she's like

116
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,740
okay arrange for a different day I'm

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,180
like Mom I don't think I said how

118
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,740
special this watch is and the fact that

119
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,639
you're getting it and she's like I'm

120
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,740
like what's more important the

121
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:54,080
spectacular or your parents she's like

122
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:57,240
my hair obviously yeah

123
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,639
I know I know my mom's so difficult

124
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,919
yeah okay so I had to sacrifice one

125
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,740
surprise that's cool that's good that's

126
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,139
good well played uh but at least yeah

127
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,240
she she said okay 11 30. well played

128
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:10,919
okay my mom was very stubborn so we had

129
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,720
a little the argument a little mini

130
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,520
friendly argument in the in the hotel

131
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,500
lobby and yeah honestly I was gonna

132
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,500
surprise her with the house first uh and

133
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:23,220
then second I told Patek that obviously

134
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,720
I have this very special day and that

135
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,580
I'd love to add a special watch to

136
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,600
commemorate it and as far as I know I

137
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,160
think I'm probably one of the first

138
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,860
people in the entire world to get

139
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,539
allocation for the new aquinol and yeah

140
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,919
basically I had to ruin the surprise and

141
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:37,199
I was like listen this is the only day

142
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:38,400
that Patek can do

143
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,600
um because she was like oh just moved

144
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,520
into another day I'm like Mom it's not

145
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,539
that simple and as I said I don't really

146
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,100
ruin the surprise at that point I'm like

147
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:46,440
Mom you're getting this watch which is

148
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,180
to die for like everyone wants this

149
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,440
watch every collector in the world wants

150
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,840
this watch

151
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,539
um so I was like please please just do

152
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,880
me a favor just please move your hair

153
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:59,180
and nail appointment so it took a lot of

154
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,220
convincing but we got there and then

155
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,380
July 2019 is that don't know when you're

156
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,580
watching this July 2019 was the first

157
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,740
month where I would actually managed to

158
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:10,800
hit a hundred thousand dollars profit

159
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,500
from the agency it just totally expanded

160
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,580
my perception of what was possible with

161
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,580
this agency business model

162
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,800
foreign

[Music]

164
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:28,560
so I think she has no idea

165
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,880
the way that we're going to try to do

166
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,319
this is basically say like Hey we're

167
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,060
filming like a little documentary not

168
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:37,139
releasing it now maybe just getting

169
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:39,660
clips for a future documentary uh and

170
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:41,819
and if we can go and record and touch a

171
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,220
little bit about my childhood and and

172
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:46,500
what a weird childhood I had so we're

173
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,960
gonna go record that and then

174
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,590
I'll surprise her with unfortunate my

175
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,759
childhood at home

176
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,979
[Music]

177
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,800
but the one two door is down yeah I

178
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:57,360
don't know I guess it just feels surreal

179
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,220
like

180
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,319
it's one of those very few things in my

181
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,419
life that I've thought about for so many

182
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,259
years and yeah I guess you don't know

183
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:06,259
how I feel when it happens

184
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:15,209
like bro I don't get flushing much

185

comment I was like you're the queen

no one knows

233
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:10,440
obviously she was very shell-shocked I

234
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,600
think taking her to a very dark place

235
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,399
and then springing up that surprise on

236
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,779
her I mean she told me that on the day

237
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,360
off she didn't really take it in

238
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:20,519
properly and also you know with cameras

239
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,560
and stuff like that she she hates being

240
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,079
on camera and yeah we ended up looking

241
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,540
at the house and

242
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:30,300

my dream to

247
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,040

248
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,779
